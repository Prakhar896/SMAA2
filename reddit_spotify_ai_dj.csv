Is Spotify’s AI DJ X actually good now?,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/1isppni/is_spotifys_ai_dj_x_actually_good_now/,11,1739919079.0,"I’ve noticed a bunch of my friends are listening to their DJ X queue for extended periods lately. When it first came out, the reactions were pretty mixed, most people thought it was kinda underwhelming and repetitive. From what I’ve seen, it either gives me a playlist of songs I’ve never heard before that are kinda different from my usual style but I end up liking, or it plays the top tracks I’ve been playing the most over the last month.

Has the algorithm improved over time? Is it better at curating personalized selections now? Or is it just one of those things that grows on you the more you use it? 

Curious to hear what you all think ","['I didn\'t like it at first, but I definitely find myself using it more lately.  I think it\'s doing a better job at playing what I like and what it thinks I\'ll like (the latter it wasn\'t doing as well before).

At least sometimes. I'll use it maybe once or twice a week.  I agree with some of the criticisms. It's mostly just playing songs that I've played before. Since I listen to different genres, I find it plays them in groups of maybe 5 or so songs from each genre at a time. Sometimes it goes into just playing a bunch of pop songs that would never listen to but if I press the DJ button again it skips to the next genre.

The new AI DJ in Spotify is genuinely awesome. Who has tried it?,384,https://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/1831vtc/the_new_ai_dj_in_spotify_is_genuinely_awesome_who/,285,1700859397.0,"Just in case anyone is not aware I'm not talking about smart shuffle. This is a new feature that I just noticed. In my ""made for you"" section, where your daily mixes are. There is a new thing that at first I thought was just one of the generated playlists, until I read it closely. It says:

>DJAll kinds of music, picked by your own AI DJ.

Like it says, the AI basically amalgamates all of your known musical tastes into a single thing, so it dynamically changes the genre as you listen. You can also press the new DJ button to change the genre, instead of just skipping individual songs. Which is fucking awesome IMO.

The thing that really caught me off guard was that they've attached an AI voice to the DJ. It gave me a little intro about how it's a new AI that will change the genre every few songs. And every time it changes the genre, it stops the music for 15 seconds or so and tells you about what it's putting on next, like a real DJ does. I have to admit I thought it was a really nice touch.

I wanted to hear about what other people think about this. I personally think its awesome, I really like the idea of a ChatGPT-like system that can act like a DJ and flow through different genres you're into and not only create custom playlists for you but actively talk about songs, and play shit it knows you like. Just now, it said to me ""Hey so I wanted to bring it back a few months ago to a song you were listening to a lot... here's a remix."" and it proceeded to show me a new remix of a song I know, which I really enjoyed.

I feel like this has moved up to an entirely new level here. This doesn't feel like smart shuffle. It feels like a real AI knows my musical tastes and is DJing for me, complete with the occasional talking. I for one am fucking stoked about it and I'm gonna be using it a lot for the forseeable future.

(Or at least, that's my perception)\n\n- Often when it announces that it's switching up genres, I'm enjoying the current one and don't know how to switch back to the genre I was previously listening to.\n\n- On the note of genre switching, twice in the past 3 days it's announced that it's swapping to hip-hop. No disrespect to those who like hip-hop, but it's not for me. I have no history of listening to hip-hop, and I have no liked songs in the hip-hop genre, so I have no idea why it's picking that as the next genre to listen to.\n\nThis is still early days though, and I see a lot of potential for the DJ function."", ""They should have allowed to people to opt-in or just kept it for their premium service.

Anyway, so far I like it but I really miss the good old days where I could pick a song at random go to that song's radio and find songs similar to it, now for whatever reason the song radios are based on my library so they took away the best way I had at finding new music.

This goes on pretty often, when I want to hear a more core rotation of songs I\'ve specifically liked over the years, or I\'ll add the albums that graduate here when I want to listen through them a little more frequently to assess for purchase)\n3.

I\'ll sometimes queue it up to listen to songs until I have the budget/decide to follow through on buying it. But most of what\'s here I own and moves over to my mp3 collection where I can listen to anything any time, so no reason to listen to it on Spotify any more.\n\nI use Plex to house/organize my digital collection, can stream from home server to my phone or home networked system, and I pretty much just usually download most of my songs/playlists to my phone for local listening access with no streaming needed.

Bands in genres are only associated by arbitrary factors, like location, fashion, and predicted market appeal, and are only vaguely/roughly audioaesthetically similar.\n\nThe algorithm is set up to frame bands/performers in the same genre as significantly *related*. While you can find music by randomly sampling bands within one, you’re not going to have a realistically better chance to like a band because they’re grouped into a particular genre (though you might be more likely to dislike a vaguely associated approach to music).\n\nAdditionally, the algorithm is set up to consider bands listened to together as significantly related. This might work if you’re nine and listen exclusively to top40 and meme songs, but not if you’re an adult with inclinations toward particular audioaesthetic experiences.\n\nCorporate people in the music industry, at every level, have no idea how people who aren’t children engage with and appreciate music. Once radio became irrelevant and they lost control of release, exposure, and access, they lost all understanding of the market they created or the people who constitute it. They’ve never really understood it, which is why genres in music are like they are, but now they seem to invest a lot of effort trying to take back control, ignorance and goals both reflected in the algorithms.\n\nI just engage with YouTube music documentaries and Wikipedia like they’re a buddy’s CD binder in high school.

AI DJ Xavier... only plays hip hop?,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/1ajn6ng/ai_dj_xavier_only_plays_hip_hop/,7,1707156610.0,"Hey all,

Don't know if anyone has this issue...

I listen to a lot of hip hop (releases spanning the last 30 years) so I understand that it is already part of my algorithm. However I spend a lot of time listening to other things as well (mostly EDM). I've noticed that the AI will only play hip hop. I press the button to rebuild the playlist and consistently more hip hop. 

Also, I will play music from a playlist that is about 50/50 EDM and hip hop and it will only make recommendations for more hip hop never EDM... 

Why's Spotify pushing rap so hard? If it bases it's choices off of my musical selections over all time, I had a Brit-hop phase that lasted a solid year and it's not pushing any of that. Just new popular shit like Drake, Lil Baby, Da Baby, Kodak Black, Jack Harlow, DJ Khaled garbage, Uzi... fucking Yachty... How much are these motherfuckers paying Spotify?

Has anyone switched over or back from Apple Music?,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/1l2ti0m/has_anyone_switched_over_or_back_from_apple_music/,21,1749001399.0,"If so why? 

Obviously if you’re in the Apple ecosystem it makes sense. 

I recently bought the AirPods Max and got a 3 month trial for Apple Music and wanted to experience hearing Dolby atmos/spatial audio and although yeah you can tell it’s more clear than Spotify but my main issue was that the audio was lower compared to Spotify the bass which I tend to like in my music wasn’t that great on Apple Music. 

My opinion is that Apple Music is for those who are deep into the Apple ecosystem and are absolutely wanting the best and clear audio in their music. 

However, that alone isn’t that big of a reason to make the switch. Maybe it’s due to me being with Spotify for for like 12 years. I’ve used it on Apple, Android and Microsoft devices with no issues. The Spotify UI is just better at recommending new music from my favorite artists or upcoming artist within my musical tastes. 

On Apple Music I felt lost. My playlist were all over the place compared to Spotify. Whereas Spotify felt more social with many playlists from users and its new AI DJ feature just makes it a better experience than just using a music app that feels soulless but hey at least the audio sounds a bit crisper lol ","['I want to love Apple Music so much because I pay for Apple one lol which I may cancel not sure yet. I used Apple Music off and on with Spotify for quite a while. Im back on Spotify because I have a better time with Spotifys playlist than I do with Apple \nMusics radio. Apple Music radio is actually atrocious. If I start a station from a country song there is no reason for 2pac to come on next. Which it does. Or Eminem. Or biggie. Lol I’m going to wait until iOS 19 to truly make a permanent switch but I like Spotify’s playlists. \n\nUnless you have equipment to take advantage of lossless, you’re probably not going to hear a difference. \n\nDolby atmos is hit or miss. Not worth it for me. Yet. \n\nAlso to comment on Apple Music audio being lower. It’s definitely not. I think you have “sound check” turned on it music settings.', 'I actually did the opposite. I switched from Apple Music TO Spotify.\n\nUsed Apple Music for a few years and I have actually used all main 3 music streaming services (Spotify, yt music and Apple Music) the reason I switched to Spotify is because Apple Music did not have a good algorithm in my case. There are only a few playlists that are made for you and they get updated weekly but have like 25 songs (unlike the many playlists on Spotify that are made for you automatically and have 50 songs each).\n\nAdditionally Apple Music removes your whole library if you unsubscribe unlike Spotify that keeps your playlists, library, songs, albums saved in their freemium model until you come back.\n\nI also like that you can preview playlists and albums on Spotify (scrolling through short snippets of every song) which helps me get an idea of wether the album is interesting enough to give it a full listen or not.\n\nI feel like Apple Music’s algorithm needs more improvement and a way to preview albums and playlists.\n\nEdit: more context', 'The library is better and I like that you can bring your own music that isn’t available in their library. I never use any of the social stuff.', 'I’ve switched back and fourth, Spotify feels more personal to me', 'I switched because I got the Apple one sub which includes Apple Music.', 'I switched from Apple Music to Spotify (and back and forth several times due to indecisiveness). I’ve decided to stick with Spotify though. The sound quality isn’t really that noticeable for my devices (I don’t have anything that can utilize Dolby Atmos). Spotify just has a better recommendation algorithm, and so so many QOL features that I’ve grown to love. For example how easy it is to add/drop music across multiple playlists by clicking the checkmark on the now playing screen. Or how your plays/streams count for the same song across different versions of an album (for example if I have a single version on my On Repeat and I switch to the album version, after a couple plays the On Repeat just simply swaps the versions out and I’m good to go. Apple Music resets play count when you do this because they actually track plays on individual devices which is an outdated way to handle it IMO). Also I just recently fell in love with the niche mixes, I didn’t even really know they existed because they are tucked away in the Made For You section but they are some of the best at generating what I want to hear', 'I have Apple Music with Apple One and I have Spotify. Apple Music is terrible at recommending music. Spotify’s algorithm is king. I also enjoy using Spotify on my Pixel and when I want to carry my iPhone, I can pick it up and resume in Spotify without skipping a beat. I like having my podcast, audiobooks and music in one app.', 'I switched from Apple Music a few months ago. I have rediscovered my old hobby of looking for new artists and how much I enjoy doing it. I feel Spotify is better for that.', 'I’ve been using Spotify since its inception and I personally loved Apple Music over Spotify. I use AirPod Pro 2, and although I’m not getting true lossless quality, I still notice a great difference in audio quality. It’s crisper, cleaner and has more depth, their playlists are built by actual people and don’t rely on A.I., and Apple Music looks better. Apple Music also has all the right features, at least for me. The ONLY reason I went back to Spotify is because Apple Music still has some growing to do, mainly with their organization. You can’t favorite artists with the same name, there’s other artists music tied up in other artists pages, and I’ve found multiple artists pages for the same artist because of either spelling or some glitch. It’s rather annoying. Once Apple Music buttons those things up, I’ll be going back for sure. But, for now I’ll settle for Spotify.', 'au tout début apple music était tres bon avec des propositions de playlists courtes mais ils ont tout changé et je trouve apple music....fade....deja les playlists ""energie"" et ""chill"" les 2 seuls qui vaillent sont bien, mais sans plus , la nouvelle radio decouverte est tres moyenne et n\'arrive pas a la cheville de ""decouvertes de la semaine"" a mon gout;...donc , c\'est bof, l\'application est tres stable , tres propre comme toujours chez apple....mais je prefere largement spotify avec ses ""decouvertes de la semaine"" ses ""niche mix"" et la ""daylist""', 'I came back to Spotify from Apple Music cause i missed using it a little bit and they offered me a 1 month subscription for $0 so i didnt have to pay for a whole month and im kind of digging the DJ X guy even though he can be a bit sassy if you skip the songs it suggests too much which is hilarious seeing him get mad when you skip songs but other than that its good to be back in the green circle gang. 🤣', ""I like the daily mixes enough to keep with Spotify.

Spotify VS Apple Music,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/1h7nxev/spotify_vs_apple_music/,26,1733443463.0,"Overall I believe Spotify is made for the people that seek out new artists and songs and don’t wait for things to get popular. Spotify is an innovator in its industry. They’re always coming up with new ideas and updates while their competitors are still trying to catch up from features they made months or years ago. It’s for the people that like to customize and intricate everything, making it their own. Spotify is better for the many reasons, here are some of the ones I could come up with:

* **Jams** \- Arguably one of the BEST innovations Spotify or any music company streaming platform has ever created. Invite your friends to a “jam” to listen to the same music together whether on the same speaker or virtually, miles away. Additionally the Jam will give group recommendations that show songs everyone would enjoy based on everyone’s taste and listening preferences. I absolutely LOVE this feature and would switch over to Spotify just for this tbh, I use it all the time. Wildly better than SharePlay which compared can be very restricting.
* **Playlist Control** \- Another more recent feature is the ability to add a song to multiple playlists at the same time. When you click on a song it will show you all the playlists it’s currently saved in and which ones you can add it to if you want. This is INSANELY useful for people like me that have many playlists for different genres and moods.
* **Made For You Tab - Discover New Music**
   * **Blends** \- Create a blend playlist to have Spotify “blend” you and your friends music taste into a playlist you both can enjoy. It will also tell you your music taste similarity as a % and tell you the #1 song you both have in common. Additionally there’s another playlist called “Friends Mix” that shows trending music among your blend friends, updated daily. Once again another way to find new music.
   * **DJ X** \- A personal AI DJ that recommends old and new favorites, switching up the genres every so many songs. Will also recommend you new songs they think you might like. Cool feature tailored specifically to your taste.
   * **Discover weekly** \- a playlist that updates every Monday with new music specifically designed for your music taste. Found so many artists this way I would’ve never found otherwise since they aren’t popular at all.
   * **Release Radar** \- a playlist that updates every Friday with all the latest music from artists you listen to currently. Singles, albums whatever it might be so you don’t miss your favorite artists drops.
   * **Daylist** \- A personalized playlist that updates throughout the day, everyday, to match your mood and listening habits. It’s very cool and weird at the same time, you just gotta see it to understand that names can be hilarious at times.
   * **Mixes** \- Whatever mood, genre, artist, decade, niche, or whatever you can think of Spotify somehow has a mix for it specifically catered to your music taste. Just search up what you're looking for, be as specific as you want, and there will be a mix made for it for you. There’s literally tens of thousands of personalized mixes.
   * **On Repeat** \- Top songs your listening to as of recently
   * **Repeat Rewind** \- Top songs you were listening to in the past
* **Song Previews** \- This was added in a more recent update within the past year. Every playlist and album will have a preview feature that plays around 30 seconds of each song, which you can scroll up and down through, kinda like TikTok. This is very useful for people like me that listen to all the new music every Friday. Usually that will take me forever but now I can get through it much faster. It starts in the middle of the song so you can get a good idea of if you’re gonna like the song or not after 30 seconds. This also doubles down as a new way to find music as they added this TikTok like feature to the homepage tailored to specific genres.

* **AI playlists** \- This is a feature added just a couple months ago that will turn your ideas into playlists using AI. You can literally type in just about anything and it will make a playlist to match that, keeping your music preferences in mind.
* **Cross Play / Transitioning Between Devices** \- You can control your music from any device, very smoothly. For example you could be playing music on your computer but controlling it from your phone or vice versa. Also works with smart TVs, consoles, smart speakers, fridges like literally anything you can play music on. I could be miles away at work controlling the music that is currently playing on my computer from my phone. The key point here is that this all works smoothly with no bugs.
* **Computer Application** \- Another huge reason why Spotify is better is because of the PC application. It’s incredibly smooth, user friendly and updated often to match the phone app. It will also show you your friend’s music activity and what they are currently listening to or listened to most recently. It also shows you your top artists and songs this month. Ask anyone you know that’s an avid pc user, they will tell you they use the Spotify application I guarantee.
* **Customize Your Playlist Cover in App** \- This was added literally like last week, it’s still in beta but works great so far. You can create your playlist cover in the app adding text, images, backgrounds, stickers, basically whatever you want. Not needed but really cool of Spotify to do.
* **Smart Shuffle** \- Another shuffle option that will play your current playlist on shuffle while also adding new recommended songs tailored to your unique taste.
* **UI & Aesthetics** \- Spotify just looks so pretty, especially looking at my library once I added a cover to all my playlists it’s very aesthetically pleasing. The app overall is very easy to navigate.

* **Sorting** \- Your entire library can be sorted by how you would like with the click of a button. With it be the order you placed it in, alphabetical, recently played, you pick how your library looks. Additionally all your playlists can be sorted as well by artist names, recently added, albums names, whatever.
* **Audio Quality** \- You can edit the audio quality that plays for songs from normal - very high. You can activate cross fading to allow for seamless transition between songs. You can also edit the equalizer to change the way the audio will sound, some options include bass booster, HipHop, Jazz, Vocal booster, there’s a ton of options.

Apple does have Lossless audio, however it generally only works with wired connections, something many people don’t have including myself. Either way, it’s very unlikely that you’ll actually hear a difference between lossy and lossless music, even with good wired headphones. Even Apple themselves say there is very little difference between AAC and lossless, they are just offering it as an option. 99% of people are not going to actually hear a difference, especially if they are buying low to mid-tier headphones for it. And then on top of that, many people do not have adequately good hearing even if they have high-end audio equipment.

* **Podcasts & Audiobooks** \- While I don’t listen to podcasts & books I’ve heard Spotify is an amazing platform for this and some people use the app just for this feature.
* **Live Events Tab** \- The live events feed where you can discover all the live events in your local area from artists you listen to. Sort by dates and genres. Save events you are interested in so you won’t forget or miss out on them.
* **Merch Tab** \- Every artist's profile can choose to enable the “merch” tab that can show current merch, vinyls or anything they are selling. When I really like a new album that comes out it's cool to see the merch available for it right on my Spotify app.
* **Visuals** \- A perfect example of one of the many times Apple Music has copied a feature from Spotify. Visuals will play looped videos uploaded from the artist while a song is playing. Usually a small clip from the music video to give you an aesthetic vibe of the song. Spotify had that for years before Apple hopped on the train.
* **Paying Their Artists** \- Based on each platform's average pay per stream rate, Apple Music does pay more than its rival Spotify. But take that with a pinch of salt. No music service actually ""pays per stream"" and Spotify pays out a larger total sum of money in royalties to artists and rights holders. Also don’t forget Apple music doesn’t have a free ad supported tier like Spotify. That makes a BIG difference. Spotify is paying for streams that are being listened to for free, Apple music is not.

Additionally, Spotify offers artists many ways to make money Apple music does not. Shopify integration for merchandise, promoting concerts/events and better linking tools, which can enhance promotion and engagement. Spotify promotes finding new music overall and allows for smaller artists to be found in the first place. You can’t get paid if you haven’t been found yet, Spotify allows them to be found.

But if you're picking services because one pays artists half a cent more per stream, just go buy the song directly if you have the option. Or go to a concert. Streaming as a business model inherently concentrates wealth in the streaming providers and record labels, every option you have perpetuates this fact and your best bet is to opt out if you care about that sort of thing.

* **“I want to make the switch to Spotify but I’d have to move over hours and hours of music”**

There’s actually many websites online that can transfer playlists and music across different platforms at the click of a button. Here’s the one I used in the past: soundiiz

* **“My phone service/parents pay for apple music” “It’s cheaper to stay on Apple Music”**

"Created an Apple Music ""My Station"" feature using Last.fm API, Spotify API, and a bit of Python.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/1lozloy/created_an_apple_music_my_station_feature_using/,0,1751370632.0,"I returned to Spotify after using Apple Music for two years. Apple Music is great, but it has several recurring downsides that became frustrating.

Top reasons for moving back to Spotify:

\- Apple Music has no Linux app (Spotify has one)  
\- AM's limited features in the web version  
\- ""My Station"" plays random tracks and never learns my preferences  
\- Can't sort playlists by recently added in AM  
\- Infrequent updates (Spotify is up to speed)  
\- Insufficient API (Spotify has Spicetify, etc.)

The only downside with Spotify is its playlist-based listening method. I often don't know what to listen to. I love the ""My Station"" concept that Spotify lacks. AI DJ isn't available in my country and reportedly isn't impressive anyway.

So, I took matters into my own hands. I created a playlist that generates itself based on my 10,000 loved tracks on Last.fm. Whenever I want to ""Shuffle all songs"", I use a smart shuffle on my ""My Station"" playlist.

My parents were also probably the last people on earth that bought individual tracks, so I set up a family plan.

I was immediately impressed at all the new features, the AI DJ actually works quite well for me. I thought I'd moved most of my playlists over to AM back in the day but I apparently didn't, rediscovered tons of tracks.

Setup for my parents was pretty painless actually, kudos to Spotify's UI, despite all the features they actually self-taught themselves how to use it very quickly. My dad loves the AI DJ ""Xavier even knows my name!"". 

The social aspect is really what makes Spotify work I figured out in that setup with them, they were able to subscribe to other user's genre playlists, and some Spotify generated ones and get up and running immediately. From no playlists to listening almost immediately.

I'm hoping in time the AI can be spoken to, especially through Alexa, my mom tried a couple times and it clearly isn't something  that's available yet. I would say the AI's UI could be improved, I noted my mom not liking one of the st.patrick's day picks and I had to show her the button to make it restart. There should be ways to thumbs up and down songs from the AI.

&#x200B;

**Spotify Notes.**

&#x200B;

Spotify Notes. When adding to a playlist/moving a song or folder or adding a public playlist to the library, you should be able to add a note with why it was placed there. 

It would be cool for little reminders, nostalgia, but also add meaning to a playlist.

THEN with the AI DJ, it could use those notes and use it to better suggest songs.

THEN it could also be used for search.

&#x200B;

AND if you collaborate on a playlist with another person, it could be used as a message to be like ""This song reminded me of you!"" 

or ""I know this song is overplayed, but I just had to add it"" \[context being to our car playlist\] 

Then the AI would use those notes and the playlist name/context to know why I would have said something like that.  


the nostalgia of going into an old playlist would be amazing

but also organizing my music so I am not re-creating playlists all the time, notes would help me.

Then if it could be used for search, I could search keywords to make NEW playlists of songs from all of the playlists that contained the context of: BLAH  
(with maybe the ability to use an AI language model to search with natural conversations, and have it curate playlists based on the feelings/context of notes added?)  
The notes could also be used for custom tagging or keywords, etc. Maybe even for adding a note about which friend shared the song with us, etc.","['I\'d use this.

I did try to follow your Twitter account, but there does not seem to be anything on it.￼\n\nEdit: I fucked up the Twitter account. It is @getradiantapp', ""This is a really interesting idea.  However, I think it's coming from some false assumptions about what people want from radio, and why we sometimes turn to it instead of Spotify.  Personally I have both Spotify and XM radio subscriptions, and use them both at different times, depending on what I'm looking for.  However, this app could not replace my XM subscription.  But an app that could, powered by AI, is an attempt worth making!  So take my comments not as criticism of you or your basic idea, but rather some reflections on why I use XM Radio, and why this app doesn't do anything to replace that use case.  Also, as a disclaimer, I'm another blind person.  So my feelings on these matters might be both stronger than and different from yours.  \n\nFirst and most importantly, the mix.  The regular Spotify app, while it tries to equalize the volume between songs, does a really basic and terrible job.  It also has no equalizer, to smooth out the frequency ranges of different songs recorded in wildly different places by wildly different people.  And the way it crossfades just isn't that useful. When I've dedicated myself to listening to music, that's absolutely fine. I want to hear the song, exactly as the artist intended.  But when I'm listening in the background, especially while doing mentally intensive tasks, I don't want to be riding the volume and treble knobs with every song change.  So I turn to XM Radio; while I know their studio engineers will make every song I hear sound bland as hell, I can trust that I'll never have to make any adjustments, and a surprising acoustic change won't jerk me out of whatever I'm working on.  Your app, however, solves none of these problems.  Every song comes in at a different volume, and with a different sound.  As well, because you don't even do basic crossfading, I'm constantly jerked back and forth from music, to complete silence for several seconds, to talking, to totally different sounding music, to more silence, etc.  This winds up being even worse than the default Spotify app for background listening.  \n\nSecondly, the DJ content.  News and weather are things that I either want to know, or don't.  If I do want to know, I'll look up the news and weather on my phone.  If I don't want to know, timely information like this in the background is distracting.  It would be far better to give biographical info about the next or previous artist, a bit of information about the album, maybe say something if the band is coming to my city on tour soon.  Otherwise, stick to bland semi-interesting content (cat facts, maybe?).  If something grabs my attention, it's a delight.  But if it doesn't, it's not distracting.  I'm not an expert on any of this stuff, though.  But there seems to be some templates that radio programmers/DJ's follow here, that could be easily replicated by an AI.  \n\nThanks to Satellite radio, voice tracking, and national syndication, most radio might as well be run by an AI anyway.  An app like yours could bring some much needed layers of personalization to an industry that's currently just serving the lowest common denominator.  I don't think it would be a huge challenge to create an AI that can correctly equalize and mix everything, and Spotify and other websites with API's have enough info for an AI DJ to pull from.  But the days of traffic and weather radio are, I think, mostly dead and gone.  Focus on providing the ultimate lean-back, background listening experience, and you'll really have something.  \n\nHeck, if you can get it right, you could probably sell it to existing radio stations.  With Google's recent demos of human sounding text to speech, I'd be shocked if clear channel and others aren't already working on something like this to replace the few remaining humans who work for them.\n\nEdit: Yup, this is a thing.  https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180802005710/en/iHeartRadio-Launches-First-of-Its-Kind-AI-Technology-Deliver-Unparalleled"", ""You can now share your two cents and guide the development of Radiant directly! \n\n[https://trello.com/b/vAHDLoRK/radiant-ideas](https://trello.com/b/vAHDLoRK/radiant-ideas) simply join the public Trello board, comment with your ideas under the first card in the ideas bucket or let us know what you think of the ideas listed, once and idea gets enough feedback it'll go into the good, bad or must do bucket and then move into development, you'll also be able to see what features have been completed and are included in the app by looking at the 'done' list!\n\nLooking forward to your input!"", ""I would be very interested but when I tried to download it, it's saying that I need an apple account.

Another thing is having the option to choose Celsius or Fahrenheit for weather because i am an American and I have no idea what 2C is haha. Have you considered having the DJ also work with playlists?

As the article mentions, I also think they executed their AI DJ (as it currently stands) pretty poorly which is what prompted me to seek out some kind of 'add on' and find this post in the first place. Their current dj is essentially a glorified perpetual discover weekly playlist with a sprinkle of music that you don't want to listen to shoved in your face. The whole point of what makes the concept exciting in the first place is the idea of there being useful and personalised information between the music that you actually want to listen to."", 'I’ll give all of those hosts a listen and pick up traits that could be applied!!

I can probably make this dynamic, if you’re in the US, use F else use C, but brilliant, this is why I love beta testing.\n\nAnd finally yes, I’m seeing lots of feedback here around playlist integration (custom and other), I’ll retool the app to allow Rad to host not just the dynamic station, but public and private playlists too,\n\nLove it all!', ""Hey!

How to Optimize my recommendations,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/17a7ups/how_to_optimize_my_recommendations/,1,1697574540.0,"I have been enjoying the AI DJ feature latley but you can really start to notice the limitations after listening to it for awhile. I love it, and have been using it daily, but there are some things that i wish were more intuitive.

Firstly, how do i get Spotify to recognize that I dont love someone that theyre pushing on me. There are artists that i get recommended both in DJ and radio mode. I listen to heavy music quite a bit, and Spotify thinks i love 'Johnny Booth', which, theyre fine, but i dont want to listen to them so much.. i feel like older verisons of Spotify had a thumb down button, which would be helpful because i dont want to block Johnny Booth but i I just wish i could tell spotify to chill.

Like when i listen to 90's alternative radio they think, 'ok let us pepper you with the foo fighters'. and i enjoy the foo fighters but i want to lessen the amount Spotify suggests by 75%

I know, I can track forward. this isnt the biggest deal. but I work at a desk, and an ideal situation would be that over time my spotify will be super calibrated to my taste, thus less distractions during the workday. Its more a productivity concern for me.",['I’m fairly certain that skipping a song feeds into the algo. You can also go into your queue and remove song and artists you’re not interested in hearing.

I'm thinking to improve it would be cool if we could talk to the DJ. For example while I'm at work I can ask for something for focus and now I'm gaming I want to kick back and relax etc. Or even asking questions about the song im listening to if its theme heavy etc",[]
i love the new enhance feature,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/14sl6l7/i_love_the_new_enhance_feature/,0,1688676147.0,"alrighty so: I love the new enhance.

ever since the new update, I’ve noticed that the enhance feature (when used on my liked songs list) is different. it’s like the AI DJ but doesn’t yell at you. it still shuffles your music like normal, except instead of throwing in a random recommendation every now and then, it strategically queues songs in order based on artist/mood. sometimes it’ll queue a bunch of songs by the same artist all in a row, or it’ll stagger them between new songs that match the vibe. i cant get enough. 

side note, i find the AI DJ to be super annoying…like i don’t wanna hear a robotic male voice yelling at me everyone couple songs. 

anyways, does anyone else notice this change? does anyone else fw as much as i do??",[]

Mixonset is like a primer if you want start DJing. Or if you want to just lean-back and chill - it's great for mixing your Spotify playlists. A surprise that came to us was that Mixonset users find way more songs since we mix in suggested songs into the queue rather than at the end.

We only launched the Premium version a month ago, and so far people are already hitting us up with really cool feedback. We'd love to know what r/spotify thinks :)
