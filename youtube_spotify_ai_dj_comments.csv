@DavidQuick,"THIS IS INSANE! After using the DJ feature for an entire day, I must say we are living in a time of true AI innovation. I'm no longer saying ""In the future.."" in terms of where we are with this technology, this is the NOW. Sure, people are going to have a sour taste at first. Honestly, I don't blame them. Music is so ingrained into our lives. It adds color to our world, it amplifies emotions, and memories when hearing a familiar melody. I think the thought of having an artificial intelligence get the taste/control of the human experience that is music, puts people on edge. This feeling is valid, and that's okay. I obviously don't have the technical understandings of the AI's processing, but I must say it's a user friendly experience. It does a pretty decent job at utilizing all the music on your Spotify. For example, it may take your through memory lane by picking out a specific year. For me at least, it went back to a playlist I created in 2017 and it played my most repeated songs. Brought me right back into the summer of 2017, and how obsessed I was with EDM. The AI will also take note of your music trends. I don't know about yall, but I hop from one music genre to another lol. One week I'm listening to 80s pop, the next week I'm obsessively listening to the sound track of Interstellar by Hans Zimmer. The AI picked up on this and gave me a few songs to listen to. Whether the songs were classics to me, it also tossed in new music from the genre to keep it interesting. Pretty insane tbh. Regardless, music is what you make it. OBVIOUSLY, no one can nor should tell you how to listen to your music. If the new feature obscures your experience then turn off the AI. ALL I'm saying, sometimes it's nice to change things up instead of rotating the five songs that I'm currently obsessing lol. Again, this is just my experience.",2 years ago,91
