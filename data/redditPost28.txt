About the new AI DJ...
I think this is a neat feature to have and saves me from looking through daily mixes. I do wish it had some custom options like different AI voices and telling it what mood you're in. But it just started so we can't expect much. What do you think?

The voice in between songs is amazing.
fuck ai. the downfall of humanity
I like it more than other playlists Spotify creates for me but wish the DJ voice was available for desktop.  Does anyone know if there is a date that is expected to happen?
I wish the things the dj said didnt feel so scripted. It always feels like the things he says are things hes recorded in a studio and is just said to everyone
I’ve been enjoying it. Love that I haven’t had any repeat songs yet.
I would say greed, corruption and a general lack of morality are closer to the downfall of humanity than AI. But what do I know?
search DJ and it should come up as an option
That in itself is amazing since that is not the case. The audio is generated on your phone
Part of me is very skeptical of that. He gottttaa have somr set of prompts because ive seen people get the same exact sentence except the genre is swapped out. "today is a vibe and that vibe is x, heres x". Like i don't know i wish there was more variety in his words
