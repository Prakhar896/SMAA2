Focus music playlists that are AI free?
I'm mostly tone deaf, so I personally can't tell the difference between AI instrumental music and that made by humans. 

However, I don't support AI being used for music or art (I don'tcare about the AI DJ I just dont like genAI). I listen to chill "easy listening" focus music with no vocals when working. Does anyone have recs for artists or playlists who make this kind of stuff?
Comments:
Try selecting for playlists by genre instead of vibe. I'll switch between classical, jazz, post rock, blackgaze, drone metal depending on task, mood, and season. Still a chance you'll get some AI slop (shoegaze has fallen into this hole), but you're more likely to get user-created playlists of actual artists.
