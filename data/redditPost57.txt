What is the DJ feature
While updating Spotify and got premium in a long time (two years ago) i discovered this popup saying "The DJ feature is not availabe in your country" "We are working on this. While waiting on this feature listen to the playlists that are based on your listening history on the Curated for you page." "Not now"; "Go to Curated for you" (for the buttons). I wanted to ask what is the reason of this and what it is and what it does (the DJ feature)?

It's just an annoying AI DJ who plays stuff you either always hear or never wanted to hear. You aren't missing much.
It's very repetitive, plays mostly the sames songs over and over, music already in your likes repeatedly and the dreaded "here's the songs that are blowing up the charts" it constantly wants to throw at you. Your not missing much.
Some people miss the FM radio listening experience so Spotify came up with an AI DJ that talks before sets of 5 or so songs. Then announces what will play in the next set. 

I don’t mind it. I’m sure younger people who never really listened to FM radio may find it annoying.
I actually like it. Basically it's supposed to mimic a actual DJ. What it does is give you songs you've listened to before, and some you may like but haven't heard. It will give you 4-5 songs in each music genre and if you dint wanna hear a specific genre you can skip it.
