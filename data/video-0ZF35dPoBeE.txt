I've had premium for like 7 years and live in us and still don't have it. It's so frustrating
Been using Spotify's AI DJ for the past few days now and I really like it! It's not so different than the current "radio algorithm", but the DJ avatar narrates between mini set lists of about 4-5 tracks, each with its own user-tailored theme.
So simple and I couldn't figure it out on my own😂 thank you for making such an easy video to follow. Also I appreciate how you leave when you slip on up on words in the video, it makes it feel like I'm learning from another person instead of just googling information.
It is ONLY available for premium users in the USA and Canada. It is in beta testing.
1:43 bro didn't skip ivy, you're such a W 🙏
Regardless of updating the app, I am a premium user and don't have this option.
the more interesting question should be, how to get the beta function on different country's
0:43 I click music and all I see is my liked songs recommendations and that's it no green circle ?
I think having AI DJ is really awesome. I have a few playlists on my account and sometimes it does get annoying to switch them around. But it's really clever to mash everything together and play songs I haven't heard in a while. Nothing better than having your own personal DJ. Clever Idea
When I heard DJ I thought it was gonna beatmatch, do stem separation and some sick stuff. This is pretty much Loquendo + ChatGPT imitating a radio MC
It is actually cool and helpful.  If you have Spotify on a computer it is good there as well.
I don't have the dj icon at the bottom right corner of my screen.
I still dont have this option? 😢 i have premium and im in the us and updated
I have had premium for 2 years now, I am on a supported phone in the us literally reinstalled Spotify I still can't find dj anywhere or any dj setting
Literally had premium for years in the correct region and I'm one of the people still waiting. Really like the idea too but guess I'm gonna have to wait
I have it, and It literally shows songs I dont know but love it, works on all people (as im a family plan of 6 family home members like siblings), its so fast and smart.
i have everything updated to where it's even more updated than the version you had in this video and i still dont have the dj popping up for me.
My main problem is that I don't even have a music tab
Perfect video. Thanks for the help.
Slowly rolling out to users
i dont got it but peiple ik do its so fucking annoying
I deleted it and reinstalled and it popped up after that try it out
@romerogaytan i have 2.5K songs downloaded…and i need like a hour to redownload the songs
@serbanandrei777 I tried redownloading and it didn't work
Seriously I'm premium why don't I have it like wtf I'm paying for if they're gonna give it to non premium users fuck my life
@Drewicitoz you paying for no ads, downloads, and getting to choose waht songs you want played
SAAAME AND I DELETED THE APP AND DOWNLOADED IT AGAIN AND STILL NOTHING
I STILL don't have this lol, I've been premium since 2016
@derek2339 i jus got it literally just happened lmao
I don't want the new Spotify
Snap, been using since beta 🙃
Still don't have it
@Drewicitoz nice pfp
Mby bc spotify is swedish :/
@lucastye4087 thanks you too bro
7 years? Rookie numbers buddy, I'm going on 12 years. Despite country, If U've given em thousands of dollars I feel like you should get it anyways😂😂
Hey, try going to the search bar and typing in dj if you scroll down it should be there, that's what I had to do
@mjtheclown9161 Ty
@mjtheclown9161 You sure you found ai dj and not just a playlist by someone else
I live in Poland and I don't have it
It rolls out differently I've just got mine today
I haven't had premium overly long and I couldn't get it the way this guy explained, but I did go into the search in Spotify and typed in “Spotify DJ” and it came up. Not I've got it. So maybe try that?
I just noticed that I have it today. You will probably get it soon.
Have you tried AI DJ these days?
The just added it for me rn
@derek2339so I thought I didn't have it either cuz when I clicked on the "music" button, the dj wasn't there. But then I went to the search bar in Spotify and I typed dj and it popped right up. It's been working just fine so far. Still not showing up in the "music" section tho.
Same here 😢
@mjtheclown9161Thanks for the tip. Typed in search bar and found it.
Fr
I have samsung a54 and just found it because I seen it on tiktok
Still nothing
It needs premium and its only in a few countries
I can't get rid of it I need helppp 😔😭😭😭
It's been 2 years and I don't have it yet
Germany still doesnt have it :(
Woop woop
I had premium plan like 2 years now
I'm a premium user in the US. Makes no sense why I don't have it
@KenHoadley prob bc you are not a beta tester (beta menas it is in testing and not everyone has it)
Not the hero we deserved but the hero we needed. Thanks from the UK for explaining :)
is it still limited only to the USA and Canada?
How long time will they beta test? Nothing in DK
You're the real deal 🙏
Now I got it today. April 7th, 2023
But it is a joke of an option, the guy from the hood talking with the street style of language, I do not use it.
@maximusaugustus6823 you dont like it because it uses the persona of a black person 💀
still don't have it
Use a vpn like me
@GotHighPing Does it really work with vpn?
@myownname5 for me it did not work
@GotHighPing Do you like to lie because it makes you feel valuable?
@GotHighPing nah if yall have premium DO NOT USE VPN all of your downloads are going to get deleted
Lol fr, I was ready for some mixes! Especially as an EDM fan. This "DJ" is just meh for now.
Press search and type dj
same I am in the US and have premium
@presg YEAH
You have to update the app
@kunalbhardwaj8803 WE DID
I didn't even know Spotify came out with a new update.
Works for me. Thanks!
I have a brand new iPhone up to date phone and app I'm in the us this isn't there. What do I do?
Thank you, helped me figure out how to open it, their instructions weren't the clearest
If it's not showing up you can also just put DJ into the search bar and click the first option
Thanks for the instructions
It's badass Fr 💯💯💯
I only wish I could tell it what mood I want to set or maybe what type of music to look for and play. Like if I want party music, or gym music, or maybe morning vibes, I simply want to be able to choose. I guess that's just me being picky, but if the AI was able to do this it would be very awesome.
I thought spotify already curated new music based on my likes. If that was the case over the past years, isn't this announcement just to join the AI trend and lure users to using the service more?
In canada and is a premium user. I have it! It works like magic
Spotifys new AI DJ is NOT AI. It is 20 years old relational database tech (and a bad one at that). Sadly, "AI" is now an overused marketing buzz word.
an upgrade of the 'discovery weekly' playlist, (i still dont have it🙂)
Thanks 🎉
I have a question I can't see the dj icon at the bottom right of my screen
When is this function available in the Netherlands?
