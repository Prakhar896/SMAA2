Spotify AI DJ just repeats the same tracks from the same artists.
I listen to the DJ every couple days and it seems like it constantly just plays the same 30-40 tracks over and over. 

I appreciate that it knows which artists I like but cmon man, at least gimme some deep cuts instead of the same “singles” from my favourite artist 100 times a month. 

I literally just want a shuffle button for artists I follow.
Comments:
the dj is a fantastic idea, but the execution is poor, it's as you've described.

since it is still in beta, i have hopes for it improving. deezer's flow is everything spotify's dj should be, but isn't.
DJ plays it too safe; I want it to play some 3,000/monthly played songs and introduce me to new sub-genres I've never heard of.
I don't have the DJ yet. Is it rolling in phases? I live in India.
