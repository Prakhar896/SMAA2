The AI DJ is so bad it's actually good 
The AI DJ Spotify introduced can get repetitive at times, but it did what Spotify failed to do. True Shuffle. Since 2016, I've wanted a feature that Deezer had, over on Spotify called "FLOW" which did a shuffle of literally every song you liked, including your playlist and similar songs and recommendations to those. Spotify never had this, just categorizes daily playlists, which is okay, but I like my music mixed at times. The DJ really does exactly that, sometimes categorizes music, but can switch the taste at a single click.

“Yo, let me play somethin’ you never heard befo’” *now playing million dollar baby*
i hate DJ so fucking much idk why i ever put it on. it’s literally just my On Repeat playlist combined with all the sabrina carpenter chappell roan nonsense that spotify wants me to listen to.
“Here’s a song you haven’t played in a long time”

Plays one I literally play everyday 🤣
I get the same 20 songs over and over, with a few new ones I don’t care about. 

My dad’s coworker sometimes plays his Spotify at work for everyone. Apparently the AI DJ mentioned a new release from Frank Sinatra. My dad and his coworkers were dumbfounded, lol. 
Nah i fw spotify DJ + daylist. Good mixup for when the playlists aint cuttin it
The stupid AI dude mispronounced “Touché Amore” so bad that I couldn’t stop laughing and had to turn it off lmao
I kind of love him, and I usually find hype men annoying. But he knows just what I like~
I just wish it wouldn’t cut songs short, and it sucks you can’t go back to the last song played if you like a song but forgot to heart it though.
Not sure if i'ts just me but the recommendations the AI DJ adds are so ass...

He only adds incredibly huge songs from artists i already listen to 😭😭😭
I just hate the way it talks.  Cringe af
The slang hip hop personality does not fit my genre of music he talks about at all. Which is post modern rock.
The DJ makes me feel like AI still has a ways to go.
I don’t mind the playlist, but I don’t listen to the radio because I don’t want to hear some knob (real or otherwise) talking.

just play music, please.
When I use the DJ, the first few songs are go, then says we are going back to something I had on repeat a few years ago, and it’s something I’ve never heard or played before
I can’t with the voice
Couldn't we have an option to change its voice?
When they announced the DJ I was so excited because I miss radio show hosts without the ads. I also don’t wanna pay for Sirius, but for me it just plays the same groupings of songs anyways. I think it’s goodish, but it needs some real upgrades.
My dj playing sleeping sounds 🥴🥴🥴
Anyone knows when this feature will be available in Europe tho?
I don’t think it ever plays anything I don’t already have in my main two playlists lol
Stupid thing just plays songs I just listened to
There is quite literally nothing Spotify could do to make me want to use the AI DJ.
I like the new AI feature a lot more than the DJ.  It's not great,  but I've used it to generate some decent playlists.  I like that I can give it a list of artists and request a playlist that lasts a specific amount of time.  It saves me having to do that manually.  For example, I fed it a list of artists I plan to watch at ACL next weekend and it generated me a 2.5 hour playlist of those artists.
The DJ is mostly mediocre, but it can be good. I’m a huge hiphop head, and when I tell you the DJ actually put me on to some old school songs I’ve never heard before I was shocked.
I hate that I added standup and now it gets thrown in randomly to every “shuffled” playlist 🤣😭
It's awful. It is worse than Pandora 15+ years ago. It will play the same songs in order over and over again every time you restart the DJ. Then, when it branches out it just goes wild. There is no rhyme or reason to it. It will start playing Taylor Swift and stuff. Bruh, I came up in the 90's. I listen to Soundgarden and Wu Tang Clan and you think I want Tay Tay and Olivia Rodrigo? What?
I’m in love with Spotify, DJ and I hated at the same time. Why on God‘s green earth is it always playing the same block of five songs? I listen to thousands of songs every year.
They call it AI but all the DJ is doing is pulling from the playlists in your Music tab. All your Spotify wrapped, daylist, discover weekly, "Your Top Mixes", plus the generic ones like Rap Caviar." It's not AI, it's not learning at all, it's just a line of code pulling from those lists and putting this outdated DJ personality program over it.
Never use The Dj in public
“Here’s a song you listened to 200 times in 2023 baby one more time…”

Well damn thanks for exposing me AI DJ😭
Oh, come on, now. It's not that bad.
I can’t listen to it. For the uk it needs to have a British dj…
I think it's fine and if I don't like what it's playing I hit the DJ button until it does...

Last month it was absolutely AWESOME!  A bunch of new artists with songs I instantly liked. And it came at me with a nice mix of some new and old favorites
This gave me a good chuckle lol
Right now, let’s switch it up. This is your favorite artist back in 2022

*plays all Disney because you listened to one Disney song*
What the fuck is up with that anyway? I thought I was going insane and they had it out to get me!
It really wanted me to listen to that Morgan wallen and post Malone song 
It once put on deli by ice spice and that was it for me. Still haven’t forgiven it
“here’s some hits from today’s top artist”

bih — i dont listen to those mf’ers — ever..  in fact i purposely listen to older music to get away from the new shit — what on gods green earth makes you think i want to hear sabrina carpenter..  i couldnt pick her out of a lineup before i found waldo


oh — i know why — big labels paying for plays, so they shove it down our throat
Yeah, what was up with that bullshit. The first few days it was playing stuff from my playlists that I liked. Then it started being like "Here's some music that's popular on Spotify" and I thought, "oh no" and it was that Sabrina Carpenter trash. Like all the shit Rick Beato complains about. Then it played that shit Morgan Wallen Post Malone song. You can't even just tap the DJ button if you're in your car and it's on Android Auto, just have to keep skipping to get to a new playlist.
They are shoving chappel mid down my throat so hard it’s so annoying
Chappell Roan is probably better than your entire library tbf
You don’t have to use it
Classic Spotify. Don't want you to accidentally discover new music in your music app
It said "Throwback to 2010s, here's some cico P" when the song came out in 2021. I'm here laughing, plus the song isn't even in my liked anymore. But at least it was true shuffle. 😂

My main gripe with spotify was, it absolutely disregards my oldest liked songs, I have over 1200 songs liked, and it only plays the recent few songs, I felt like it was my list that was ass lmao.
For recommendations, just a little bit of digging on YouTube gives you such golden underground songs.
How do you do my fellow youth
Yeah they really need other voices, pretty jarring to wrap up a metal song then have his voice float in.
I was curious if everyone got the same voice.
Its not a continent thing, ive had it for months (Sweden), its on a user by user basis i guess
Yeah I was thinking I'd prefer the harry Enfield and Paul Whitehouse Deejay characters, poppickers, but I'd settle for a AI Tony Blackburn  🤣
Even freakin Waze has dozens of options for voices, I get AI is a bit different but no excuse not to have some alternatives
‘Befo’’—I can hear it 😂😂
Happens every time man
Yeah, me too, that song is shit on a turd.
Thank god I've never had "here's some hits from today's top artists" Even Spotify is aware I hate that shit with a passion
Get some taste bro
The Roan glazing is insaneee
Fans like you are why people hate her and her fanbase lol

i listen to the music i like instead of the recycled pop trash that pop culture wants us to like. :)
oh wow i never thought of that thank you !!!!
For me it's the same

If i use Spotify DJ it ONLY plays my recently liked songs, and for some reason only the HipHop ones even though i listen to quite a bit of Pop and R&B.
Not recommendations, i meant to say like, songs that the DJ adds that aren't in your playlist
Exactly!
Absolutely one of the bbc hosts. Radio 6 would be a good model.

Not just the voice but the whole attitude is so grating to me. Not just an American comment though, a British rap style presenter probably wouldn’t do it for me either…!
Now we can start thinking … could they open up the APIs so maybe we could run our own models at least for the speech output (Spotify conversely will be very good at the actual music selection)
It’s just sounds so  unspecial to me. I think I have a lot of bias bcs of how much I am bothered by it feeling forced on me. If I want new and good girly pop type music I’d listen to charli or Magdalena bay
Try changing it to the Spanish language dj
Mine thinks I only listen to 90’s rock for some reason.
“I got the perfect song for you, something you’ve never heard” plays smells like teen spirit
