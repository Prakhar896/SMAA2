I wish I could block certain songs from ever coming up in the ai generated playlists
Spotify reckons they know Iâ€™d like a certain song, it comes up in every daily mix, and every â€˜song radio based onâ€¦â€™ plays list when I listen to rock music.

The song is a collaboration between the metal band north lane and the dubstep DJ phase one.

I love north lane but canâ€™t stand dubstep, and as such I REALLY donâ€™t like this song. And yet, every time I listen to north lane or metal core in general, Spotify thinks itâ€™s grand to slip this other song in the mix. I wish I could just block this song.

I don't see why they don't already have that as a feature, it seems so obvious when they are so reliant on algorithms and guessing to figure out your taste for you. Inevitably it's gonna keep pushing one song that you don't like and all theyet you do is put up with it til it gives up
Iâ€™ve already blocked phase one as an artist, but I LOVE north lane, and so I keep getting this one damn song. Iâ€™ll be rocking out to some hectic metal and this dicky dubstep song comes on and I gotta hop out the shower and skip it ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
