Honestly, DJ X being unable to pronounce artists' names is one of the few highlights of using him... though, I wonder how he's influencing people who haven't heard actual people saying them.
I thought it was 😐😑😐 182
I thought it was “blink dash one hundred and eighty two”
Just read they added 182 to their name to avoid a lawsuit. Why 182? It is O.G. Internet slang for “I hate you”
I heard it say Noelle instead of Noel Gallagher today lol
It’s always been Blink One Hundred and Eighty-Two! You’ve been saying it wrong this whole time?
I thought it was blink 69
Speaking of the AI, we had band practice yesterday. Was struggling with a part (I'm the drummer) of the song plush by STP. I thought I would take a break from all the songs we practice and just jam to the AI, what Friggen song pops up first thing? Plush!!!! Dammit Jim!
The one I find quite funny is "And next up is Double-yew Aye Ess Pee" (W.A.S.P., generally pronounced Wasp).
surprised we are shook at the actual correct way to say numbers
Ai Dj called Tom Cochrane a one hit wonder once.
I mean, in Italy everyone calls them "Blink cento ottanta due" which is literally one hundred and eighty two so I just assumed it was normal
Just wait till you hear what it calls CKY 😆
I'm shocked too.... one hundred and eighty-two would be Blink 100.82
People use that stupid thing?
Maybe she was referring to rapid eye movement

Mine refuses to say “slut”. Always pronounces it “slute”
I think they’ve fixed it, but he used to really fuck up artists with Japanese names. For instance, Akatsuki Records, whose name is formatted as 暁Records on Spotify, was consistently pronounced “Creckords”. 

He also pronounced Dangerkids as “Dank Rids” once. I have no idea what was going on in that neural network of his to think of that one.
It's because of the name of an Italian band "Blink"
In the 33 years I've been on this planet I have never heard anyone say blink one hundred and eighty two. The thought never even crossed my mind to be honest.
Why should I waste my breath say saying one hundred and eighty to its easy just to say blink 182

In english, you would colloquially call the band "Blink One Eighty Two". English speakers often drop the qualifier out of bigger numbers, for example street addresses might be called:

* "One Twenty Three" instead of "One Hundred (and) Twenty Three" for '123' or
* "Twelve Thirty Four" instead of "One Thousand Two Hundred Thirty Four" for '1234'
yes people use things
I will be saying it like that moving forward
Are there 182 emotes?
so how you usually say it?
420!

I just never understood the point of an "AI DJ." It's just a radio station with a stupid fake voice.
Dude, I didn't get it when I first saw his comment, I just thought some weird dude replied to me. Shit... I'm so disappointed at myself for not getting it
Blink one eighty two. It's even weird to spell it all the way out like that.
Yay! Let’s explore each others bodies now
