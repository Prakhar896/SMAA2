Spotify VS Apple Music
Overall I believe Spotify is made for the people that seek out new artists and songs and don’t wait for things to get popular. Spotify is an innovator in its industry. They’re always coming up with new ideas and updates while their competitors are still trying to catch up from features they made months or years ago. It’s for the people that like to customize and intricate everything, making it their own. Spotify is better for the many reasons, here are some of the ones I could come up with:

* **Jams** \- Arguably one of the BEST innovations Spotify or any music company streaming platform has ever created. Invite your friends to a “jam” to listen to the same music together whether on the same speaker or virtually, miles away. Additionally the Jam will give group recommendations that show songs everyone would enjoy based on everyone’s taste and listening preferences. I absolutely LOVE this feature and would switch over to Spotify just for this tbh, I use it all the time. Wildly better than SharePlay which compared can be very restricting.
* **Playlist Control** \- Another more recent feature is the ability to add a song to multiple playlists at the same time. When you click on a song it will show you all the playlists it’s currently saved in and which ones you can add it to if you want. This is INSANELY useful for people like me that have many playlists for different genres and moods.
* **Made For You Tab - Discover New Music**
   * **Blends** \- Create a blend playlist to have Spotify “blend” you and your friends music taste into a playlist you both can enjoy. It will also tell you your music taste similarity as a % and tell you the #1 song you both have in common. Additionally there’s another playlist called “Friends Mix” that shows trending music among your blend friends, updated daily. Once again another way to find new music.
   * **DJ X** \- A personal AI DJ that recommends old and new favorites, switching up the genres every so many songs. Will also recommend you new songs they think you might like. Cool feature tailored specifically to your taste.
   * **Discover weekly** \- a playlist that updates every Monday with new music specifically designed for your music taste. Found so many artists this way I would’ve never found otherwise since they aren’t popular at all.
   * **Release Radar** \- a playlist that updates every Friday with all the latest music from artists you listen to currently. Singles, albums whatever it might be so you don’t miss your favorite artists drops.
   * **Daylist** \- A personalized playlist that updates throughout the day, everyday, to match your mood and listening habits. It’s very cool and weird at the same time, you just gotta see it to understand that names can be hilarious at times.
   * **Mixes** \- Whatever mood, genre, artist, decade, niche, or whatever you can think of Spotify somehow has a mix for it specifically catered to your music taste. Just search up what you're looking for, be as specific as you want, and there will be a mix made for it for you. There’s literally tens of thousands of personalized mixes.
   * **On Repeat** \- Top songs your listening to as of recently
   * **Repeat Rewind** \- Top songs you were listening to in the past
* **Song Previews** \- This was added in a more recent update within the past year. Every playlist and album will have a preview feature that plays around 30 seconds of each song, which you can scroll up and down through, kinda like TikTok. This is very useful for people like me that listen to all the new music every Friday. Usually that will take me forever but now I can get through it much faster. It starts in the middle of the song so you can get a good idea of if you’re gonna like the song or not after 30 seconds. This also doubles down as a new way to find music as they added this TikTok like feature to the homepage tailored to specific genres.

* **AI playlists** \- This is a feature added just a couple months ago that will turn your ideas into playlists using AI. You can literally type in just about anything and it will make a playlist to match that, keeping your music preferences in mind.
* **Cross Play / Transitioning Between Devices** \- You can control your music from any device, very smoothly. For example you could be playing music on your computer but controlling it from your phone or vice versa. Also works with smart TVs, consoles, smart speakers, fridges like literally anything you can play music on. I could be miles away at work controlling the music that is currently playing on my computer from my phone. The key point here is that this all works smoothly with no bugs.
* **Computer Application** \- Another huge reason why Spotify is better is because of the PC application. It’s incredibly smooth, user friendly and updated often to match the phone app. It will also show you your friend’s music activity and what they are currently listening to or listened to most recently. It also shows you your top artists and songs this month. Ask anyone you know that’s an avid pc user, they will tell you they use the Spotify application I guarantee.
* **Customize Your Playlist Cover in App** \- This was added literally like last week, it’s still in beta but works great so far. You can create your playlist cover in the app adding text, images, backgrounds, stickers, basically whatever you want. Not needed but really cool of Spotify to do.
* **Smart Shuffle** \- Another shuffle option that will play your current playlist on shuffle while also adding new recommended songs tailored to your unique taste.
* **UI & Aesthetics** \- Spotify just looks so pretty, especially looking at my library once I added a cover to all my playlists it’s very aesthetically pleasing. The app overall is very easy to navigate.

* **Sorting** \- Your entire library can be sorted by how you would like with the click of a button. With it be the order you placed it in, alphabetical, recently played, you pick how your library looks. Additionally all your playlists can be sorted as well by artist names, recently added, albums names, whatever.
* **Audio Quality** \- You can edit the audio quality that plays for songs from normal - very high. You can activate cross fading to allow for seamless transition between songs. You can also edit the equalizer to change the way the audio will sound, some options include bass booster, HipHop, Jazz, Vocal booster, there’s a ton of options.

Apple does have Lossless audio, however it generally only works with wired connections, something many people don’t have including myself. Either way, it’s very unlikely that you’ll actually hear a difference between lossy and lossless music, even with good wired headphones. Even Apple themselves say there is very little difference between AAC and lossless, they are just offering it as an option. 99% of people are not going to actually hear a difference, especially if they are buying low to mid-tier headphones for it. And then on top of that, many people do not have adequately good hearing even if they have high-end audio equipment.

* **Podcasts & Audiobooks** \- While I don’t listen to podcasts & books I’ve heard Spotify is an amazing platform for this and some people use the app just for this feature.
* **Live Events Tab** \- The live events feed where you can discover all the live events in your local area from artists you listen to. Sort by dates and genres. Save events you are interested in so you won’t forget or miss out on them.
* **Merch Tab** \- Every artist's profile can choose to enable the “merch” tab that can show current merch, vinyls or anything they are selling. When I really like a new album that comes out it's cool to see the merch available for it right on my Spotify app.
* **Visuals** \- A perfect example of one of the many times Apple Music has copied a feature from Spotify. Visuals will play looped videos uploaded from the artist while a song is playing. Usually a small clip from the music video to give you an aesthetic vibe of the song. Spotify had that for years before Apple hopped on the train.
* **Paying Their Artists** \- Based on each platform's average pay per stream rate, Apple Music does pay more than its rival Spotify. But take that with a pinch of salt. No music service actually "pays per stream" and Spotify pays out a larger total sum of money in royalties to artists and rights holders. Also don’t forget Apple music doesn’t have a free ad supported tier like Spotify. That makes a BIG difference. Spotify is paying for streams that are being listened to for free, Apple music is not.

Additionally, Spotify offers artists many ways to make money Apple music does not. Shopify integration for merchandise, promoting concerts/events and better linking tools, which can enhance promotion and engagement. Spotify promotes finding new music overall and allows for smaller artists to be found in the first place. You can’t get paid if you haven’t been found yet, Spotify allows them to be found.

But if you're picking services because one pays artists half a cent more per stream, just go buy the song directly if you have the option. Or go to a concert. Streaming as a business model inherently concentrates wealth in the streaming providers and record labels, every option you have perpetuates this fact and your best bet is to opt out if you care about that sort of thing.

* **“I want to make the switch to Spotify but I’d have to move over hours and hours of music”**

There’s actually many websites online that can transfer playlists and music across different platforms at the click of a button. Here’s the one I used in the past: soundiiz

* **“My phone service/parents pay for apple music” “It’s cheaper to stay on Apple Music”**

Actually Spotify is cheap if you use the student discount, it even includes Hulu for free! Even if you're not a student anymore you just need to have access to your college or even high school email account, which you should still have access to as long as you haven’t forgotten the password.
Comments:
Do you work for spotify?
Spotify is all I have ever used really in terms of services, and I don't have any plans to switch or use any other atm (besides Youtube for occasional stuff I can't find). One note about the student discount, this is only available as I recall to a maximum of 4 years.
I use Spotify because its free 🤷🏽‍♂️
I’ve had Spotify for music for years but I use apple to listen to podcasts. I was going to switch podcasts to Spotify but I don’t like not being able to remove episodes from new if I don’t want to listen to that episode. I want to follow the shows but occasionally I want to skip an episode. The only way I’ve seen to remove from “new episodes” is to mark it played which will screw up the 2025 wrapped stats.
Solid, thorough review!

This is more about the feature itself than what you wrote, but "AI playlists" completely misses the point. You make a playlist to experience making a playlist, not just to \*have\* a playlist.
Thats the biggest Ad i ever see on Reddit , Spotify is good but the Control and the Handling are dumb and ever, Update make it badder
You can, without a doubt tell the difference in audio quality. I use Spotify simply because of the shared playlist where both sides can add music, idk if Apple has it now but two years ago they did not and I’m not going back to check.
Como usuario de ambas debe decir que apple music es horrible la verdad, muy dificil de usar, tienes que rebuscar las opciones, no es intuitivo, aparte que la interfaz en macos es una mierda asi de simple, me parece increible que una empresa como apple no pula su propia aplicacion para escritorio. Uso ambos servicios pero en definitiva me quedaria con spotify la unica razon por la que me pase fue porque compre todo el ecosistema de apple y ciertamente funciona mejor con los homepod mini pero es lo unico la verdad decepcionante...
Lol I wondered the same thing. Very good review. Do you do reviews for a living or side gig?
Nope lmao, just really passionate about music
I agree but it’s a cool feature to use sometimes just for fun
what control and handling are you referring to? I feel like with every update the app gets better.
Not even I just got tired of the Apple Music vs Spotify debate so wanted to put it to rest
Then you should buy your music. Physically. Support the artists. And listen to it in a way better form than Spotify’s shitty compression. And stop telling people to lie to get it even cheaper.
You covered it very well.
You could do freelance writing, though these days it is harder to  get accepted by publishers and editors.  AI is killing some of the jobs.
You should too then bud.
Haha well thank you. Unfortunately I’m kinda horrible at writing, I’m just really passionate about this topic so that’s why
I do, thanks. But I'm not the one running around asking about being "passionate" about music, while listening to it on shitty Spotify with shitty earbuds probably, and telling people to lie so they can get it for $5 a month.
Why you so mad bruh, Spotify isn’t shitty at all it’s better than apple. Did you not read the post bud? Also who wouldn’t want to save money lol you don’t make sense
How come every time someone disagrees on Reddit, it’s always “U MAD BRO!”

I’m saying…you can’t say “I’m passionate about music” and then pick the streaming service with the worst audio quality and the lowest payout to the artists, and at the same time advocate for lying to get it even cheaper.

Being passionate about music, you should care about the people making that music, along with the quality of the music.

Like being a self proclaimed “foodie” and only eating at McDonald’s.

And to answer your question, I did read your post. And I disagree. That’s fine though. Or should I say “WHY U MAD BRO?!”
No todo el mundo tiene para comprar un dac, audifonos de estudio y vinilos. Deberias revisar tus privilegios, hay gente que le encanta la musica, pero no puede permitirse todo eso, asi que acuden a las plataformas de streaming para poder consumir musica, y lo que te hace un apasionado de la musica es consumirla no tener un stereo de 3.500 dolares.

Pero bueno que se yo sobre eso, solo soy un ignorante.
