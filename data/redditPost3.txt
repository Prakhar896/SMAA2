The new AI DJ in Spotify is genuinely awesome. Who has tried it?
Just in case anyone is not aware I'm not talking about smart shuffle. This is a new feature that I just noticed. In my "made for you" section, where your daily mixes are. There is a new thing that at first I thought was just one of the generated playlists, until I read it closely. It says:

>DJAll kinds of music, picked by your own AI DJ.

Like it says, the AI basically amalgamates all of your known musical tastes into a single thing, so it dynamically changes the genre as you listen. You can also press the new DJ button to change the genre, instead of just skipping individual songs. Which is fucking awesome IMO.

The thing that really caught me off guard was that they've attached an AI voice to the DJ. It gave me a little intro about how it's a new AI that will change the genre every few songs. And every time it changes the genre, it stops the music for 15 seconds or so and tells you about what it's putting on next, like a real DJ does. I have to admit I thought it was a really nice touch.

I wanted to hear about what other people think about this. I personally think its awesome, I really like the idea of a ChatGPT-like system that can act like a DJ and flow through different genres you're into and not only create custom playlists for you but actively talk about songs, and play shit it knows you like. Just now, it said to me "Hey so I wanted to bring it back a few months ago to a song you were listening to a lot... here's a remix." and it proceeded to show me a new remix of a song I know, which I really enjoyed.

I feel like this has moved up to an entirely new level here. This doesn't feel like smart shuffle. It feels like a real AI knows my musical tastes and is DJing for me, complete with the occasional talking. I for one am fucking stoked about it and I'm gonna be using it a lot for the forseeable future.

What do you guys think? Have you had good experiences? drop your thoughts.
Comments:
I really liked it at first but after using it a few times, it does what all the other curated or shuffle playlists do- it plays the same fucking songs every time.
“Let’s switch it up, this one’s called the worst fucking music you will ever hear.”
Nice try Spotify marketing team
At best, it has “potential.”
It only plays songs from my liked playlist, I don't see the point. I was out out for a walk earlier today and skipped 20+ songs in a row looking for anything I haven't heard 100 times. 

"Here's songs you're familiar with"

"Let's look back at your listening history in 2022"

"Here's some songs you might recognize starting with [artist]"

WHY? You'd think if there was anything cool for an ai to do, it would be finding some songs for your music taste, not shuffle
I feel like I’ve seen this exact post multiple times in the past 3 months
I've tried it. Why would I want a voice intruding on my music?
Nah, the DJ voice makes my social anxiety flare up cuz I feel like my guy is judging me.
It could be better. Feel like it cycles the same music over and over sometimes. Then it plays shit I would never listen to in a million years
This reads like an ad. Weird.
No thanks. I hated radio for the same reasons I hate this feature. It plays songs and music I don't like or want to hear.
I like the Daylist feature more than the AI DJ
I’m mostly a fan. I find that Spotify’s algorithms are not great as a whole (too repetitive or plays something I have no interest in.) But AI DJ has consistently played songs I like and introduced me to some new ones I like without going down a rabbit hole of bad songs. Some of the comments it makes about my vibe or whatever are not accurate, but it works for me- especially as someone who likes a lot of very different genres. YMMV.
It’s fun but I wish it becomes more customizable
It’s fucking terrible. Keeps throwing in shit I would never listen to. I prefer the usual Spotify radio which actually puts on stuff similar to what I’m listening to
[deleted]
Not available around here.
Putting lullabies on for my baby at bedtime has absolutely fucked Spotify for me. It thinks that no matter what 'made for you' playlist I select that I'd enjoy some random instrumental bollocks in the middle of it.
I can't find this. 😞 What are the steps to open the AI DJ within the mobile app?
"Let's  hear some song of your day's back in school",   the asshole doesn't know it was one of the worst moments of my life.
Adposting
I genuinely hate it
I don't want Spotify to change genres every few songs. If I'm in a jazz mood, I play jazz. If it started playing hip hop I'd think it was broke. When I tried it, it played some general pop/rock stuff then played a classical piece. Pop/rock I like and classical I like, hence why the algorithm / AI picked it, but why would I want it mixed up? Totally jarring.

Plus if I wanted to listen to someone taking nonsense, I'd listen to commercial radio. I use Spotify to avoid it.
My dj experience is the complete opposite. For the past 8 months ive been listening to only heavy metal. Decided to try dj to see if it would give me new bands related to what i listen to only for it to give me conpletely different genres and after 50+ skips i gave up and went back to my playlist. This is like the 3rd time i tried it and will probably never try it again. Also have the fact it cuts out the first and last few seconds and has that stupid ai talked every 5 songs or so
I find it really nice

 I'm usually not one for going out of my comfort zone and finding new music, but the dj recommends stuff that I actually enjoy and it's expanding my music horizons somewhat. 

I really enjoy that the genres switch up every now and then and you can easily skip to a different type of music as I generally am up for most things in most moods. 

The voice is also a really nice detail. It feels like my own personal little radio host and i use it quite frequently
It's great having a DJ with my favorite tunes. It even says my name! It's a bit lacking in personality imo you don't interact with it like a chat bot so it only talks about the music and doesn't make jokes or talk about current events like a human DJ. I pretty much listen to the same music from the 90-2010 so it's selections limited to that, I don't like other genres besides Rock and Metal, but it's tried some hip hop song that I actually like.
I love it. I love everything it does and if it suggests something I don’t like, one button and it skips
I like when it plays songs from a particular time period like 'here's what you were into in October 2019'
I keep telling it that I dont want to listen to System of a Down and it keeps putting it on the queue.
its a bit of a hit or miss at times for me, tho I love when it will give some information about a band and/or a song they're about to play, that gets my attention most of the time and is a bit engaging and probably one of my favorite parts of it, I'd rate the AI DJ 8/10
I much prefer the daylist feature.
The DJ was too hit and miss
“How you doin? It’s DJ X here. We’re gonna play some thing you’ve been listening to alot this past month. Starting out, Moose Blood.”
Looks like a marketing article. I’ve tried it and I didn’t like it . Keep saying the same replies and music I already know .
The AI DJ really has my music taste figured out. Some of my current favourite songs were introduced to me by that playlist.
Most be in beta cause I can't find the feature here
i fucking love it, he scares me every time he says my name but its my preferred way to listen to spotify now!
I like a lot of different music so it usually does a good job for me.  Had a couple of weeks a month ago where it was relentlessly trying to get me into ICP.  Didn't work out but we have moved on.
"Hey I'm you DJ X and let's get your Saturday started with some vibes."
I tried it twice and it was terrible.
lots of ppl mad ab it playing bad songs when it literally just came out give it a break lmao ai learns over time
Still not available in my country.
i absolutely love it!
It’s nice I like the variation in music types…. but has anyone else gotten the “heartfelt message” from the DJ about how much they love being my DJ. It was also followed by a really random polka song and an April fools lol
Literally just discovered it today and I really like it so far. I've enjoyed a few songs it recommended and I think the more I use it, the better it'll get. For me, this is AI done right, not just slapped on as a "We have AI, too!" feature. 
I think it's genuinely very good. It does tend to suggest songs to you multiple times until it gives up but it does find a lot of new music for me that I like. You definitely have to give it time to learn your tastes. If you always skip new music, or have very narrow tastes, then it's not going to work for you though.

The voice is mediocre at best, and sounds overdone, not at all natural and I don't think it's only because it's AI. It's apparently the voice of the project lead for DJ, Xavier "X" Jernigan and they do not talk that obnoxiously in interviews. Why Spotify management would allow them to make it so they are the *only* voice for their product, I have no idea. To be clear, the voice synth product they are using already has multiple voice options, it's an active choice to only have one voice. It's like nepotism but instead you are immortalizing yourself in an AI voice synthesizer with your company's money. Weird.
I like that I don’t have to make a decision about what to listen to right off the bat. I click it when I want to listen to music but have no idea what I’m in the mood for lol
iv been using this for last 2 days and it seems to just be playing my play lists on shuffle haha and maybe every 8 - 10 sounds it will through in a new song but essentially just take all the different play list i have and just shuffles it.
Worse than shuffle and an annoying voice between my songs? Nah dog, I’m good.
I want to love it i wish there was a thumbs up/ down option on songs to play more or less songs like the one playing
I thought they had just come out with this because I just got this feature on Spotify . Maybe you had to listen to a certain amount of hours to activate it or something,I don’t know . So far I like it, it’s been playing only the songs I like.
This is so hilariously obviously an ad even if you say it isn't op
It's fuckin garbage
I hate when the DJ says next up is a “vibe” - wtf is that supposed to mean? What kind of vibe?
Bruh I’m ded, it’s playing songs I listened to in 2019 💀
I would love the DJ more if they add a Hide Song button and it quit playing songs I already hid. Other than that, the AI DJ is alright but plays a lot of the same shit on a daily basis
Just want to add that it switches songs before they finish which I really don't like. That feature needs to go.
God awful… started trying to play billie eilishnand stuff.. I’ve never listened to that crap in my life.. how much are her record label paying Spotify to put her on people’s playlists? 🤮
I like it but I don’t like how it cuts end and beginning of songs out. Hopefully that will stop one day.
Mine plays the same list of songs. You hit the button and it switches to the last set of songs it gave you when you hit the button....in the same order. Its actually driving me crazy rn. My smart shuffle does it too....like stop playing the same songs in the same order every time I hit the damn button.
I agree. It does have potential. I love what it could be.

Looking closely, I don't like how they kinda try to send songs that I don't even care about. 

Hopefully when it makes a comeback it will be refined.
I LOVE it! But the only downside is it will still play artists you have said "Don't play this artist" for.
[removed]
I think it needs work still.

The person talking is novel but repetitive, it also claims to use AI but it's not impressive. 

It often plays songs I know and exist in my playlists while saying I might not have heard of them.

It would be cool to have a choice of voices.

It would be nice if it knew facts about certain older records that it should share, like Trivia before introducing them.

I think going to a song I like and then clicking "go to radio" gives me a better music journey than the DJ feature.

I can see it being very powerful if they work on the AI and features some more.
I enjoy it sometimes it plays good new songs but all too often it puts forth garbage like modern hiphop or big name popular. Im primarily country and 80s rock with a little conservative rap, redneck hick hop, metal and some game/ nightcore not sure where it gets the idea wap or similiar would be acceptable. 
Does anyone onow if the ai learns based on what you chose to skip? Normal playlists have the block song ability but i havent noticed it in dj. So im really hoping it learns
What about this one? 
I'm just learning about this because I always use Spotify via Sonos where there are massively missing features, like this one 
[https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-04-07/spotify-premium-users-can-now-turn-any-idea-into-a-personalized-playlist-with-ai-playlist-in-beta/](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-04-07/spotify-premium-users-can-now-turn-any-idea-into-a-personalized-playlist-with-ai-playlist-in-beta/)
Late to this but I tried it for the first time today and found it seriously lacking. It needs to be curated by genre or per playlist curation. I have a huge pallet of genres that I enjoy. but I am in the mood for one genre that means I'm not in the mood for a different one.  think old school country to heavy metal to classical to grunge. if I'm in an old school country mood I don't want to hear heavy metal mixed in. When I'm working I listen to ambient trance when I'm cleaning give me some southern rock when I'm working out Ambient trance does not work for me. So for me it gets a fail.
It would be cool if they had an AI function that would know what kind of music you tend to listen in different times of the day, when you're working, when you go to the gym, when it's late at night. I know chatgpt already can do this so it's a matter of the spotify devs to work on it. Also you should be able to speak to it and tell it exactly what you want at a determinate moment or if you really like or hate something.
Holy fkn christ I want to MURDER that ai prick. It’s so gawdamn awful it’s not even funny. They gotta justify their ai investment somehow. UGH I already HAD a shuffle feature….but now I get some annoying prick interrupting to explain what he’s doing, and doing terribly. Also, when friends send song links through Snapchat this bastard highjacks the play and changes it to some suggestion I hate. Meanwhile, because it’s Snapchat the link is gone. This prick needs to die die die!
I agree with you, just started using it today, it’s great!
Wow, a lot of people complain, I’m shocked:) I absolutely loved that feature! I pretty much like all kind of music, and that kinda person that gets bored with a certain playlist but can’t be arsed to look for something else, ai dj is a godsend for me, yes sometimes it played I wasn’t into, but you can press one button and it changes it instantly:) love it:) 
Play DJ X from Gulf Shores back to Nashville last month. It played songs I had liked, songs that were from similar artists and then sometimes it would play songs I never played before. I found it very intuitive. Much better than hitting random on a playlist.  It blended some songs, faded them out, and started some songs right at the verse.
Even if it's playing songs I like (rare), it jump-scares me with "LET'S SWITCH IT UP" and then changes to bad music once again 😭
I've started using it. It's decent for a first iteration but could do with some improvements. These will likely happen over time.

My observations in particular:

- It tends to repeat songs too often when used multiple times. (Or at least, that's my perception)

- Often when it announces that it's switching up genres, I'm enjoying the current one and don't know how to switch back to the genre I was previously listening to.

- On the note of genre switching, twice in the past 3 days it's announced that it's swapping to hip-hop. No disrespect to those who like hip-hop, but it's not for me. I have no history of listening to hip-hop, and I have no liked songs in the hip-hop genre, so I have no idea why it's picking that as the next genre to listen to.

This is still early days though, and I see a lot of potential for the DJ function.
They should have allowed to people to opt-in or just kept it for their premium service.  I personally don't like anything about it. I would prefer to delete it entirely.
In my opinion, it's just a worse version of the regular algorithm playlists spottily usually gives you. I don't want a stupid AI voice talking to me. I just want to listen to my music. The worst part is that it always skips the first 15 seconds of a song for no reason. And it doesn't even align the "vibes" of songs together like it claims it does! Quelle Suprise (by Ursa Major) and Escapism (from Steven universe) are the complete opposite genres! I can't think of two songs that are more different from each other! I know it's in beta but still. It's just such an unnecessary feature.
I've been using it all week and while it has played a few songs more than once, it hasn't played them on the same day. I drive a truck so I'm constantly in and out pausing and playing again. What really annoyed me with shuffle and smart shuffle is the selection of songs repeats after an hour or 2 and is almost always the same, I have 130+ hours of music in my library fucking pick some songs from the other end of the playlist. Anyway, so far I like it but I really miss the good old days where I could pick a song at random go to that song's radio and find songs similar to it, now for whatever reason the song radios are based on my library so they took away the best way I had at finding new music. I hope they give us a few more customisations with the DJ, like here's 5 songs from my library play some music similar to them that I've never listened to yet. Time will tell if it will be a staple of my listening.
I *love* it. It's not perfect (seems to think that the Doobie Brothers are disco & funk, e.g.), but it's a great idea nonetheless. Wish it was on the desktop app.

Another thing I noticed is that the AI DJ was able to say my name.
I hate how it fades in and fades out on each song rather than playing them to their entirety.  And it always gets the years wrong.
I like it
Let's switch it up, here's some hits from the 2010s you'll love, plays 70s Aerosmith.
I really like it, and I have found a bunch of new songs by using it. 

I just want it to adapt a little based on the time of day.

 I listen to very different music early in the morning than I do in the evening.
I like it at first... but he keeps starting the same playlist over and over.  I thought each day would be a new experience.
I just discovered this feature this morning, so far I’m really liking it. It transitions songs really well, just like a real DJ would with fading the previous song out as you slowly introduce the new song, and it skips the intro part of songs to get you directly into the house beat in my DJ experience. Very cool.
Yeah no, its genre descriptions are really bad and it will randomly start playing spanish music for me.
I'm recently having a  different experience than most others' reports 
DJ has gone from playing music that I already listen to, or is similar to playing stuff that I don't like
ai wrote this post
They should kill it.
It’s shit 
That's Spotify’s worst feature. It keeps giving me shit from artists I clearly clicked the “do not play this artist” button. It thinks because I am in Latin America I would love reggaeton and Bad Bunny and for an AI it is very deficient that it doesn’t understand what songs I dislike. It seems it is just a tool to push the songs they want. Nice job music industry.
I loved the dj feature at first. An auto-curated playlist based on my music was right up my alley. But the last year or so, I've been becoming increasingly agitated by it. It's proven to be its own little echo chamber. It plays music it for whatever reason figures I want despite never listening to it before. Then because it doesn't have any way to tell it "I don't like this," it keeps playing it. Repeatedly. And it counts it in its little tallys of "You've been listening to this a lot lately," or "You've really been into this," so it keeps coming up as a big hit with me despite slipping the damn songs repeatedly. This last new year's wrapped was horrendous, with three of my five top bands being ones I either dislike or don't listen to, and my top songs category was almost exclusively songs I've never listened to before in my life.

If Spotify wants to push this, they REALLY need to figure their algorithm out, and give us a damn dislike button.
Scared the crap out of me when my car stereo started talking to me!
I’m so late! I just discovered it and I love it!!! Such a great idea 💡 only problem is I have a sleep playlist I listen to every night so that may disturb the flow but so far it’s great!
I think the more varied your general music is in genre, the more eclectic your listening is, the better the dj is. It's fucking incredible for me, I've found só many new bands to listen to!!
I wish there was a way to save the playlist. I don't mean individually, the whole list since you turned it on on the day.
I was on my way to work today, and DJ X says “I’m gonna go take a bathroom break,” plays one elevator song, and comes back like “yeah, that’s all I got for that one” sir. what? I mean I love the chaos, but sir.
Everyone complaining simply does not listen to enough music frequently enough, or for long enough for the dj to work properly 😭 unironically my favorite feature on spotify and its new music suggestions are spot on
Yo, I have Spotify premium… but I can’t find this “AI DJ”
i like it, i find it to be way way better than auto curated lists that only play one genre or vibe. this way, its basically just shuffling the auto curated play lists. ive heard as lot of music ive never heard today, and i didn't hate it. it also is playing sean pauls temperate, and dirty little secret from AAR so i just like the variety. idk if its doing it for you guys or not like that, but its working good. any sleep music i listen to has been excluded from my profile so it doesnt show up on my wrap and seems to work there too keeping it off the AI DJ
I honestly love it, it takes requests too which is even cooler
[removed]
It's repetitive, despite saying it will mix in some new songs. Sometimes cuts a song off before the end. Could be manipulated by Spotify to promote certain songs. Like the idea but it needs more work.
I don't like that I can't ask it to play one of my playlists. If it did that, Id love it. I tend to jump from one playlist to another and I don't really want to do that for example while I'm driving.
I find most people here listen to any song just once and the only thing they value is to find new songs.

I like to hear the song I like multiple times and to get a good suffle of them, so I find DJ great.

I asked for it to Never play Taylor Swift again, and it hasn’t! So that a plus🤷‍♀️😂
I think the AI DJ is totally worthless and I hope they did not spend to much money and time on developing him.
Doesn't it just replay your daily mixes with some random stuff? 
I absolutely love it! The dj voice absolutely makes this feature, otherwise it would just be another boring shuffle feature. Easily one of my most favorite improvements over the years, second only to Spotify wrapped.
As soon as I tried it, it boomed out, "HELLO STEVE IM YOUR AI DJ!" I immediately turned it off and never again
I find myself skipping a lot. I think I may have added a few songs here and there. The only huge thing it's given me is Mr. Little Jeans.
The DJ's voice is unlistenable to me. Why does it have to be such an obnoxious American accent? I want my DJ to sound like Ken Bruce
Thanks for the tip, listening now
This isn’t new and it isn’t that good
I liked it at first, but then it started to get stale.

I think the daylist is way better as it does kinda the same thing but more varied and switches up often
I wish I could set genre parameters, bc I listen to almost exclusive edm and 15 min into my listening it’ll play Notorious BIG- I have no songs by him saved or listen to much old school rap. 

I stopped using it bc it clearly did not understand my music taste, which is crazy bc all the other curated content by Spotify is spot on
I like it in theory. I think the idea of playing short blocks of various styles and mixing familiar and unfamiliar has great potential. That said, I'd love it more without the DJ voice and I'd really appreciate it if it stopped playing the same blocks over and over. It seems like I have to skip about ten blocks before it plays anything remotely unexpected. 

"Here's some stuff you haven't listened to since 2017" - yes, and there's a reason for that!

"Here's your typical Sunday vibe" - and it proceeds to play a genre I never listen to. 

"Here's some music that's been in your rotation a lot lately" - and it plays me music that is only in my rotation because the DJ itself keeps putting it on.

There's definitely potential, but the execution leaves much to be desired.
did it finally roll out for the rest of us? its been a us/uk only thing forever
If I were able to specifically select the AI DJ for one or more (or all) of my preferred genres, it would be appealing. 

Without this ability, it is a sloppy smorgasbord. 

E.G., I don’t want to go straight from Nicki Minaj to Bartok, thank you very much.
I was excited to try it but was underwhelmed by it. I want to be able to customize it… such as change the voice, change the info the dj says (artist name, track name, year, random tidbit about the artist), adjust the percentage of familiar & unfamiliar, etc. I’ve been asking for this sort of thing for many years.
How do you access it? I can't find it on the PC app. It may also be it's not available in Switzerland :(.
Is this feature only available in the desktop version? Can't find it from mobile Spotify.
How do you even use it? I am Dutch and have never seen it in the app.
I tried it and hate it. I don’t want some fake guy interrupting my music, and half the time he doesn’t even play good music. That’s what the radio is for
It gave me a new obsession. Similar to Evanescence suggestion is spot on.
I’m having fun with it. The voice bugs me a little. I wish we could pick from a choice of voices and accents. I’d rather mine sound like a classic MTV veejay. And maybe talk a bit less.
Idc, I will never forgive them for what they did to New Releases page
Where is the feature I can’t find it.
i like it occasionally but for the most part, i make my own playlists.

my only true complaint is a lack of a legitimate shuffle.
“Oh you chose to use my service bc you’re bored with your own choices? Well here’s the last 5 songs you just listened to this morning” 🤡
I think the AI DJ sucks balls and is annoying.
It’s absolute dog shit lmao I end up skipping whole blocks at a time of the terrible garbage he puts on. What the fuck about my listening history says I give a shit about the hottest new indie?
Not available in my region… 

Is it something I can fool with a VPN?
It’s more a talking algorithm than AI. If I could talk to it and get a meaningful selection based on a bit of chat I’d be more impressed. As it is it’s very repetitive with some things and very predictable with others. eg the only AC/DC track it will lay is Jailbreak. When it plays talking heads it has to be once in a lifetime, psycho killer and road to nowhere. Boring!
it pretty much plays the same stuff i would have listened to anyway. i've never found any thing new through it.

its an interesting idea but effectively useless if you wan to hear something new and if i want to hear stuff i already know i'll just put on a playlist i've made.
I don't even have it…
I really like it coming in like a radio guy and announcing what’s been going on.
in theory it's fine, i guess, i just don't want it to talk. if i wanted to listen to the radio with a dj I'd listen to the radio. i just want music. daylists are where it's at for me.
Still managed to play the most obvious tracks from whatever genre it switched to.
I like it. Not great, but good enough you know what im sayin?
I wouldnt call it "new" but my music taste is way too picky so i just skip 80% of what it gives me
I decided to look it up and sure enough it was right there...so I clicked it and the way it pronounced Rudimentary Peni made me cackle...
Mine always just plays whatever is in my main playlist. It's terrible
It can be neat but I honestly never use it. I don’t like the AI voice and one time it just gave me pop when I never listen to pop music.
I use spotify radio and it's essentially the same except it doesn't get stuck in genres and the AI voice doesn't unnecessarily interrupt the music every 4 songs or so
I've got more niche taste in music and for me it's borderline unlistenable, will play some fairly on-point stuff for a few songs, then just switch to some random shit that spotify wants to promote that doesn't even remotely align with my listening history.

I've had spotify since the beginning, so it's not like they're lacking data
I like it when I’m driving and indecisive or if I’m around people who get annoyed by my music themes
I would use it 1000% more if it was toxic AF, like GTA Radio DJs, complete with an array of voices, personalities, genre radio stations and just absolutely hilarious and shocking anecdotal and uncensored commentary of global current affairs.
This concept is completely fucking stupid, it only plays songs on your own playlists nothing from anything new. It also has the worst voice in the world, way to fucking agressive sounding. If I was to put any kind of AI dj online for streaming music I sure an hell would not have some deep voiced sounding dude with a dick in his mouth, gets very annoying fast. Spotify should be smart and change it to a womans voice and learn how to set songs that are new and not something you have heard 100 fucking times.
the dj voice clashes with my music  but it could be worse like California valley girl 
Does each of our DJs have a different name? Mine is Xavier.
It’s marked as beta. Anyone know where to give beta testing feedback?
I like it but it’s missing the mark.
The key reason I want the feature, is because I lack imagination. This lacking, causes me to play the same genres over and again. The AI has noticed this genre in my play history, and keeps giving me more.
If I wanted my play history, I would play it. I use the AI DJ because I’m bored of my listening routine. The current DJ just reinforces my routine.
Anyone know how to give such feedback to Spotify?
I came to this post because I was wondering if an AI DJ exists. 

I love to put a lot of albums in my phone, play them in random by bluetooth, so it would be very cool to have a virtual voice saying name of the song, the artist, release year, album maybe a little trivia of the song, and presenting the next one, but seems something like this still does not exist for songs stored in your phone?
Anyone who has used pandora will always feel Spotify's music recs, AI or otherwise, are hot garbage.
Literally the worst fucking thing I jeep coming back to for some stupid reason and Everytime I do I shoot myself in the foot. Who ever made it. KYS
It got boring real quick. There’s no joy of discovery.
Amen...and my sleep music is not my day music. Let me opt out of which lists it plays recommendations from. Maybe that exists already. No setup, just found it. Poor rollout.
I’ve been using him more recently after it’s been like a year now and it’s actually pretty fucking banger now it goes back to some of the same artist it played that day but none of the same songs from what I’ve noticed the past two days now, only a few times to I have to click on him to switch things up or I skip a song or so but been much better than when he first came out
I think what happens is if you use the DJ mode most of the time, it picks songs you previously listened to on the DJ mode and ends up repeating after a while as a self referencing system.
Therefore it is a good idea to go and search out some new songs to expand the selection.
It also sometimes adds some new pop music "Did your boots stop working? Did your truck break down?" but to be honest it breaks up the flavour fatigue after a lot of trance acid hardstyle hardcore symphonic metal. I also like dub though as it's relaxing compared to blasting Alignment tracks all the time.
You've never, ever listened to this genre before so I'm gonna play it for you.
Every now and then he hits me with some of the shittest music I've ever heard. He says it's the "what's popular right now".
"Here's what's popular right now even if it doesn't share a single note with the rest of your liked songs"
When he says “let’s switch it up” I know it’s going to be some dogshit 
I used it a few times but I listen to 8 or 9 different genre and many more sub genre types. Don't see that it helps that - yet. Does it?

Eg. Here's your dj for 70s, dj for 80s,... old school country, instrumental study, sleep, euro classic jazz.....
"Let's hear some of the weird shit that your kids added to your likes playlist last night for a joke when they 'borrowed' your phone, and then I'll extrapolate from that to make you listen to more shit that you won't like."
Nailed it.
💯 I would use it more if it said exactly that! 😆 😂
Or escaped AI DJ. It reads like an AI generated post.
This right here. But at the moment I just want the dj to play my playlist with out repeats. 

Please, we want an elimination shuffle option. Play all songs through, if song played = yes then don't play, if song = not played then play. Cmon now!!!
Honestly i think the potential has panned out lol
I feel like I’ve seen the exact opposite sentiment posted multiple times
This is the first time I'm seeing it.

The voice reminds me of Ice-T

It mostly plays stuff that you already listen to.
All you listen to is hip hop, r&b, and 90s rock? Here's a country song about a truck, followed by hardcore death metal... Like homie, you have like tens of thousands of tracks that vibe with my tastes, who's account are you actually pulling data from?

I've also had it go "here's something you used to listen to all the time but have taken a break from" and it's like my top song from last year... How about pulling something from 5-10 years ago that I may have forgotten about?
I hate the fading thing too. It cut out the first 20 seconds of a great song just to get to the part where vocals come in. And then it switches it up to play 21 savage for some reasoon
You can choose to exlude things from your listening profile
That’s rough
Ad posting for Spotify…on the Spotify subreddit. You lost?
... I can guarantee you I'm not being paid. I use spotify all the time. I like the feature.
I wonder if say a genre ai DJ would be more successful. Like in your case you go to the jazz genre and hit the DJ and it plays a few tracks from one part of jazz… maybe a random fact or two about the next song it switches to etc. Kind of like what the lyric genius thing?
We got a "deep cut" coming up! Yo! 

Is it an African American for everyone? Fucking nauseating.
Use the fade option for that.
Just realized this is not available in the US yet :(
> "Here's some music that's been in your rotation a lot lately" - and it plays me music that is only in my rotation because the DJ itself keeps putting it on

This is so fucking annoying
Most European countries don't have it yet. I'd really like to try it, just out of curiosity.
I want a south african accent, that would be awesome.
It’s shown me far more new music that I’ve not listened to than ones on my playlists. So I have no idea what you are on about.
If one time it plays a different genre, then either repeat the track or like it and add it to your list. It will learn from that and keep on suggesting other genres, or similar to the one it noted you liked
Right? It’s more AR than AI. (Artificial repetition.)
Try setting some of your playlist to "exclude from my taste profile". Idk if it works off of that or not.
Thanks, I'll give it another look!
I noticed this too. At first, it was bad for playing the same songs or playing songs from other languages, but lately, it's been a steady stream of bangers and I end up discovering songs I didn't know I was missing.
I wouldn’t honestly love that
This is my entire experiance. First few songs were on point to what i listen to daily only for it to then give me non stop new pop that i never listen to and never will. Dj is horrible
If you click the dj thing it will change back to the usual type you listen to. But my biggest complaint is cutting off the end and beginning of songs.
I made a post a while ago that was removed that more or less complained about this. Sometimes it gives me recs that are dead on (this is how I discovered some of my favorite skramz artists, like Blind Girls and Lord Snow) then it plays me Rap Caviar and folk, neither of which are my taste. Then it plays me "metal hand-picked for me" which is just Slayer and Led Zeppelin, whereas the metal I actually like is more like blackgaze.

I also understand why the AI DJ plays the most streamed songs of all time on Spotify, considering most people like pop music, but if those are not songs I have ever listened to and skip past them every time, why does it keep playing them?

And then it just plays music I was listening to a lot maybe six months ago but says is "my kind of music." Not wrong, I like the songs obviously, but it's a little out of date.
I consistently listen to the same genre, so I was really frustrated when it suggested something completely different. Since then, I haven't used it again.
*plays slvtcrusher*
AI dj: please play me some old school obscure rare bangers. 

"OK, Here's yellow by Coldplay."

I wish we could choose parameters. Songs under 5000 plays but rising. Genre: Cumbia electroswing. Vocals: only men between the ages of 45 and 65.
Which is just annoying as it seems to be what's globally popular, instead of what's popular within the types of music I like. I had a series of songs yesterday where it was like Taylor Swift and US Country music, like whyyyy? Literally none of my music is pop or country and I despise those genres.
It's actually one of the most natural sounding ai's out there.  


 I read they acquired the company that also did the voice modeling for top guns val kilmer.  


 The DJ voicing the ai for Spotify, had to train the software. The ai sounds just like he would,including the cadence, pauses , natural flow of speech.  


 Honestly from that perspective it's quite an achievement. In the end, it's just a shuffled list of music in random genres 
This!! Out of the 600+ songs I have liked so far, I am pretty sure that my shuffle plays maybe 50 of them. 🙄
I'd take elimination shuffle over every new feature Spotify tries
Dude the feature literally came out 6 months ago
I appreciate you posting, first I've heard of this feature and I'm really liking it so far.
Not enough to know this is posted almost daily
You should go into advertising

I digress, could you explain how to find this feature? I can't find the for you section
Disagree. It constantly gives me music from artists that i actively avoid and genres that i dont listen to at all
Not on my end. It will play some of the bands I like, then it will play shit like Taylor Swift for some reason. Not a fan.
Huh, so you can. 10+ years of using Spotify, and I never knew this. Thanks!
God you can’t even lie well
That's even worse, you posted this shit for free.
mine sounds like a new york pedestrian, half expect it to say 'heyy im walkin here'
I mean, I enjoy Depeche Mode as much as the next guy, but I never once listened to their new single and DJ keeps insisting it's my favorite.
Same lol, the recommendations are on point too.
How?
Sounds good hopefully you’ll like him more, I’m hoping it’ll be better for you on your end seeing as it is still just ai and we know how they can be sometimes
Just found this "feature" today and WTF lol... It starts the next song almost 1min 30 secs in!! That needs to change along with cutting off songs! Your point is 💯 valid.
That was my exact words when I raved about “dj” to my husband!:) it’s great, but it cuts off my favourite parts:)
Yaaaas, hate that shit but otherwise it's the only AI anything I like 
I'm just hoping it's remembering things I skip and like, so it doesn't play it again and learns. I'm guessing that info is captured if they want this to be a personal DJ. Unfortunately one of the consequences is that it will be wrong many times when you first start using it, but hopwfully learns both from your own Playlists and with your direct feedback as it tries to find and suggest good new music for you.
I'm just picking on your post but you and a heap of others have this complaint and I'm wondering why. 90% of the songs my DJ plays are already in my library. A few are by artists I already have a few songs liked from or are similar to my 80s 90s rock genre that most of my library is made up of. I'm starting to wonder if this is by design (it is in BETA), maybe there are several versions Spotify threw out there and are waiting to see which one we hate the most so that becomes the standard, that'd be on point for them.
Dj is region based, and in beta theyr probably trying new countries in batches, so it isn’t weird people are just finding out lol. I also just got it last year, while it existed a few months before
It’s in the search function
Iirc you can exclude stuff from your music taste. I never had to though.
tbf I believe it's a fairly new feature
Open playlist

3 dots

Scroll down till you see this:

> ⓧ Exclude from your taste profile

Click and presto

And to undo its the same process but with

> ⊕ Include in your taste profile
I’m guessing it might not work that great for other genres of music but for house specifically which often have slow starts and ends, cutting these out is really good.
Go to Spotify settings and turn off automix, it fixes it.
Yeah, most of the time it's my own songs or at least related by genre or artist. It only sometimes switches to "what's popular", but obviously in the US as crap like Country music isn't popular in Australia at all. To me it's so jarring to suddenly hear mumble rap, Country, or Taylor Swift when literally none of my library is like that. I would like an option to opt out of "popular" lists, especially if it's from a different country. Sometimes it switches to popular EDM in the 80's or 90's, which is kinda okay but I have to be in the mood for such nostalgia. Instead of skipping I just hit the DJ button again and it goes back to stuff I want. Overall it's pretty good though. Now if only they could change the voice of the DJ guy...
Im fully aware of that and use the feature reguarly. But yet DJ thinks i want to listen to Taylor Swift when i have told spotify not to play her. Just for one example
Thanks for the info, kinda late reply tho
Legend!
That's just went i saw it sorry

Besides you where 7 months later reply, you can't flame me lol
Nah it's cool
