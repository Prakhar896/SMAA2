What's the weirdest/funniest thing your Spotify AI DJ has ever said to you? Today, it literally just said "If you don't like this one, I'm gonna eat my hat"

F\*ck AI

He said "skip skip skip skip skip, you know there's a button in the bottom right if this isn't your vibe" 
Ok so basically i was like half asleep and i was just listening to music and ISTG ts bitch whispers “i wanna hear the next song” uhm yea no i turned that shit right off
"We noticed that you like Counting Crows. So, you'll probably want to hear this song my Barenaked Ladies."
