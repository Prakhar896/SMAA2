Ai Dj " alright here's one that was tearing up the charts eleven hundred years ago"
Starts playing Monks of the Abbey of Norte Dame - Introit Benedicta Sit



That shit had me dying when I heard that. This feature has been pretty good so far.
Comments:
Yeppp I was dead too. Sad thing is, I listened to the whole thing 😭😂😂
The hilarious part is I have been listening to Gregorian chants in preparation for my DnD campaign. So, when it came on I was like sweet. This is a great vibe.
I had just listened to Enigma's whole *MCMXC aD* album maybe 3 weeks ago. I freaking thought it was a legit selection.

Well played, DJ X.
AI Dj I’m sure has some $$$ flowing into it that artist/record labels will have their song(s) randomly plugged into the mix. Just coincidence huh 😂. All good. I’d like to give my Ai Dj a personal name as well?
I thought I was tripping
April fools, they got me
the feature is really quite awesome.  spotify as a whole is really killing it lately
I just had that happen and came straight to this sub lmao
I was kinda feelin it though, not even gonna lie
THAT SHIT CRACKED ME UP FR 🤣🤣🤣
When tf will I get this feature in the uk
Got me, too.  Funny stuff
before they said anything, i genuinely thought it was real. cause i listened to mozart every now and then, and i know they didnt come out in the same era, i thought nothing of it 😂
This feature is still not available for iOS users
I pressed next pretty quick
Would have been even funnier if it were 4:33
Same lmao
Saddest thing for me was I didn’t think anything of it. It wasn’t weird to me because I listen to a lot of classical. So I assumed it was pulling from that. Until I skipped it and realized it was a joke.
Same. I actually enjoyed it too. Lmao I was like “wow this does slap”
bruh I don't have it yet why 😭
There’s definitely sponsored content but it’s labeled and you can skip it as soon as it comes up. At the top songs will be “based on listening history” or “editors picks.” I personally don’t mind since it still limits it to genres you actually listen to
They definitely do. Everytime he does an editor's pick, it is very clearly mainstream crap from major record labels with the budget to promote it that is only tangentially related to stuff I actually listen to. I usually skip those blocks, but sometimes I guess I don't mind it keeps me at least tangentially aware of mainstream releases.
Absolutely. I never listen to Metallica but it keeps pushing in my feed.
I'm in the US and I still haven't gotten it myself. :\
Scratch that. I found A.I. DJ in the search bar
Nothing like paying for Premium and *still* get ads, which sponsored content in practice is.
You just gotta search it. It’s a playlist by spotify called “DJ”
I mean you don't have to use the feature
