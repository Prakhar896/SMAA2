AI DJ suggestions
I would love to see some interaction between me and the DJ. If I could press the DJ button an say something like:
- Keep this vibe going
- I’m not feeling this today
- show me something new in [genre]
- that last set was hot garbage
- give me something to dance to
- make this set a playlist
I think that would extend the longitude of the DJ feature.
Comments:
I would definitely like some interaction with it. I've been enjoying the feature so far, but sometimes I don't want certain vibes or blocks of music at certain times.
I keep getting hot garbage sets smh. I’d love this.
Be careful, the mod team thinks this sub isn’t question friendly.
