Smart Shuffle is really bad.
Everytime I go to my Playlists and turn on Smart Shuffle, it takes the EXACT same queue of songs everytime. Except now, it has a couple songs not in the Playlist sprinkled in. The catch; ITS THE SAME SONGS EVERYTIME. I'm never getting anything new. It feels like I'm just listening to a mixed up Playlist I've made.

I miss the enhance feature because it worked a lot better for me... I'm having the same exact problem as you. Good idea, bad execution.
SAME
When this feature was first released, Spotify made it very clear that the only option for smart shuffle is to set you playlist by data from recent to old songs. That's why the order is always the same. I'm not a big user of it, so I can't tell if they changed it now.
Oh my god it's the same with me! I thought it was my phone glitching but no
I can’t use it
it's been happening quite a lot recently
Is that the same as the AI DJ? I'm not a fan of that 
The enhance playlist button was so much better. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it. Tf is Spotify on
I believe it's different. And I agree that AI DJ is also trash
It plays the same 10 songs. I have so much variety on my playlists. Come on Spotify!
