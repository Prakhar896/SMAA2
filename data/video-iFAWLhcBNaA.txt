the cut to him singing it was actually good
“I don't listen to this shit” Sings every word
The fact he cant resist and sing along at the end, got me rolling 🤣 🤣
This is why I love X :cat-orange-whistling::cat-orange-whistling::cat-orange-whistling:
I was just casually playing my game on my tablet but while I put this on my background and this moment made my smile wide
Actual good one
He shouldn't be ashamed of his music taste
Yo but Brittany Spears is a BOP
"Eyah Dontah Listenah Toe This Shite" - * Also sings along at full volume *
At this moment, I have learned to disregard any take xQc has on music 👍
Everyone used to have Britney on repeat, why is he so flustered. She was the biggest popstar on the planet.
It's only a matter of time before this turns into TTS. :face-turquoise-covering-eyes::face-blue-wide-eyes:

yeah juicers are tripping she's classic
any popular artist that does house music = good is literally his take on music anything slower than 90 bpm he thinks is garbage.
@1100MC flashbacks to him picking some britney spears ass song over ambitionz az a ridah🗿
As a major Leona Lewis fan. I approve of this clip
Old britney is goated tho, good taste
