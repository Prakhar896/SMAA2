Spotify DJ
I’m not sure when Spotify introduced the AI DJ feature and in fact if I had known what it was before I clicked on it I probably wouldn’t have touched it because I’m already over “AI”. I am so glad I did, it is fantastic I’ve been listening to to it for like 2 days straight and it’s found me new songs and bands and throw backs and it’s literally perfect. I’ve had 1 or 2 songs I haven’t liked so far but besides that it’s flawless.

Glad you’re enjoying it. At first it worked well for me but now it cycles through the same 20 songs in random orders. I can’t even activate dj while using CarPlay anymore. I have to start from my phone before it will play in my Jeep.
Still not available in Belgium...
I rather like it. Am using it rn. Good mix. Used the “hey dj” button once or twice and it shifted to different music pretty well though one or two was too similar to the previous.  I suppose this depends on how much your music taste differs, i rather like this feature will try it out for a few weeks see how it goes.
It's garbage. Same songs all the time. Half the time it says " Here's a song from Cage the Elephant " and then it plays Pink Floyd 🤣
I just noticed it was a beta hopefully they iron out whatever is causing it not to work for you. Ive kept seriusxm just because I liked to listen to the radio but hate commercials. If this continues to work Im not sure I’ll keep seriusxm unless the price is too good pass up.
After a couple months of listening to it I had like 2 weeks where it would occasionally just play the same music over and over again idk if there was an update but it seems to have fixed itself
I guess I’m getting lucky then lol I haven’t heard the same song once with about 8-10 hours of listening straight
Actually, that was my initial experience as well.  It was great for about two weeks, and then it seemingly broke to the point I don't even bother with it anymore.
lol I guess I’ll enjoy it while it lasts
