ChatGPT integration with DJ would be cool
I recently got access to the AI DJ and it's great, I've always thought the shuffle algo was below par. 

I'm thinking to improve it would be cool if we could talk to the DJ. For example while I'm at work I can ask for something for focus and now I'm gaming I want to kick back and relax etc. Or even asking questions about the song im listening to if its theme heavy etc
