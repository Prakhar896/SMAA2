i love the new enhance feature
alrighty so: I love the new enhance.

ever since the new update, I’ve noticed that the enhance feature (when used on my liked songs list) is different. it’s like the AI DJ but doesn’t yell at you. it still shuffles your music like normal, except instead of throwing in a random recommendation every now and then, it strategically queues songs in order based on artist/mood. sometimes it’ll queue a bunch of songs by the same artist all in a row, or it’ll stagger them between new songs that match the vibe. i cant get enough. 

side note, i find the AI DJ to be super annoying…like i don’t wanna hear a robotic male voice yelling at me everyone couple songs. 

anyways, does anyone else notice this change? does anyone else fw as much as i do??
