Need help optimizing my recommended playlists.
I use my Spotify to play instrumental piano music for my dog at night to help keep her calm. She’s a puppy and doesn’t enjoying crate training…

Anyway, this 6 hours of piano music each night has completely derailed my discover weekly/release radar/ai dj. 

Is there a way to keep that game from affecting my recommended/generated playlists?

Just select "exclude from my taste profile" by tapping the three dots in whatever playlist you're using
