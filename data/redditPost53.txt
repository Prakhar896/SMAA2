How can I find new music on Spotify?
I am a person who likes different songs, I like to listen to everything, I like to listen to new artists, or great songs that are not so well known, but Spotify always plays me the same songs.

I have already used all the tools that Spotify offers, from the weekly discovery, to the AI DJ, to the random music recommendations, but I still haven't been able to find new songs that catch my attention.

It would be great if you could tell me your suggestions for trying to find new music, also if you can share your playlists or artist recommendations with me, I promise to listen to everyone.

Thanks!

Methods I use to find music on Spotify:


* Fans Also Liked section


* Artist's Playlists¬†


* Any playlist created by humans


* Intentionally listening to the wrong results when searching for something¬†
This is my Spanish speaking artists playlists. Hopefully this helps start a rabbit hole

I'm the type of person who likes to listen to a lot of the same music, so what I often do is look at my favourite bands/artists on Spotify and see what the "Similar Artists" list includes, and if I have not heard of a band, I might go and sample a couple songs just to see how they sound. I have found bands this way that I do quite enjoy and would not have discovered otherwise.

Also, you didn't mention it in your list of Spotify tools so I'm not sure if you glossed over it or haven't been using it, but for *new* music, your Release Radar is also key. It updates regularly with new songs that have been released, often by artists you already follow and/or artists that are similar to them, but the similar artists may end up being new to you.

Here's a  playlist of some of my favorites you can check out.

I usually find new music by using sites like RYM, Discogs and Bandcamp, searching by genre, country, release year, etc.
Use the search function. Search for genre, time period, mood, vibe, BPM, activity you want to do while listening, then explore the playlists that come up in the results. Look at the playlists by other users instead of spotify
don't know how good the algorithm is now but Spotify radio was how I discovered new stuff in college. if you type in an artists name and radio it will make a mix.
go down a featured artist rabbit hole. if someone collabed an artist you like, decent chance you might like some of their stuff
also to expand genres, use the stats for Spotify website and start with your least listened to genre and explore artists in that genre. also start with the pop version of a genre if you don't like the hardcore version of a genre to ease yourself into it. I did this with country and now it's one of my top 5 genres in the past few years
There's 3rd party Spotify apps that could help you with this. Eg [Brew.fm](http://Brew.fm) creates auto-playlists with new music from artists already in your playlists
