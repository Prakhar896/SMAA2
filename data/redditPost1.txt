I don’t want to make fun of the AI DJ, is it just me or sometimes it can be incorrect?
Mine said Michael Jackson was soul, and it played Beat It, and mine’s name was DJ X or DJ Xavier did anyone get other AI DJs getting things wrong, or is it just mine?

Just today my dj went Spanish for a monologue today
Lol was told a skate vibe was coming up and the first song was 
Going up the country. Followed by Mr Blue Sky
You don’t want to make fun of the absolutely shit algorithm that they’ve built that replaced their hardworking human team in the interest of “cost cutting”? Why? It ain’t gonna cry. Even it was , it would say “playing music to cry to” followed by Pump up the Jam and Blue by Eiffel 65
The mispronounciation of Artists is the worst. Today DJ X played Ann I Later. WTF? It was Annihilator.
AI is shit. No one asked for it.
QWERTY they called an angry vibe
Mine pronounced/sounded out Van Halen 1984 as One Thousand Nine Hundred and Eighty Four. He also pronounced Geddy Lee as Jeddy Lee. So, a real winner.
I have enjoyed the AI DJs but only experienced one guy. 
He sounded like a hip hop style DJ, but he was playing my Yoko Ono song mix.
I found it to be quite humorous.
They gave me Spanish music right now and something that sounds like video game music in Spanish, geez, I may be quarter Italian but I know Spanish when I hear it.
That really sucks.
That’s insane.
At least mine can pronounce some artists correctly. “Ted Pole-eee” I went like this 😓 Crush 40 they can get right..
Sometimes it can not mess up, it can, you never what you get besides, it’s still in beta.
Mine went Portuguese on me
