It's been rolling out over the last few months. I think it's pretty decent. Better than Spotify radio or whatever they called it that was a sad attempt at Pandora like taste matching.
I think it's interesting. People will complain about anything
Work fine for me. Really likes how it pick up good old blues tunes, that I haven't listen to for years. And I have discovered many blues artists that I didn't know about. Better than Discovery Weekly.
Its cool but I hated that it repeated the same tid bits inbetween songs on multiple occasions of listening to it.
Shite, not that's it's not clever or interesting. It's more like your personal radio host not a DJ, it plays songs it talks. It'd be an actual DJ if it remixed songs. But hey that's just preference
