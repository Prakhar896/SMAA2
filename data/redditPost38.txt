“AI” DJ function on Spotify?
Not sure about other playlists but on this one there is an “AI” DJ function where the end of a song connects automagically with  a section of the next song that matches perfectly with a smooth transition. Sometimes it skips to 1:37 or 0:18 depending on the track

Yeah some playlists have this "feature". I'm pretty sure a while ago those were called "Party Playlists" or something like that.
With regards to Hip-Hop playlists, I noticed that [Hip-Hop Central](https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWY6tYEFs22tT?si=ZFxKo8lqRYSgIklwDkEwTQ) and [I Love My '90s Hip-Hop](https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX186v583rmzp?si=ZTXEegauTbKczjWg3PBq5g) both have this AI DJ function. The transitions are on-beat so this feature is pretty neat. Hope they incorporate this feature on more playlists.
You linked to the song instead of the playlist 
Is there any way we can use this AI feature in our own playlists ?  
That would be the cherry ontop!
Example of such playlists? 
Edited! Thanks for pointing out
The [Dance Party](https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXaXB8fQg7xif?si=cCNJYg2qQEmObZoryTamuA) playlist for example. 
Psytrance Supernova, Housewerk and Hype have it too.
