@erikvanderheijden2571,"Been using Spotify's AI DJ for the past few days now and I really like it! It's not so different than the current ""radio algorithm"", but the DJ avatar narrates between mini set lists of about 4-5 tracks, each with its own user-tailored theme.",2 years ago,42
@honeyv2774,"So simple and I couldn't figure it out on my own😂 thank you for making such an easy video to follow. Also I appreciate how you leave when you slip on up on words in the video, it makes it feel like I'm learning from another person instead of just googling information.",2 years ago,148

@The090919900222,I think having AI DJ is really awesome. I have a few playlists on my account and sometimes it does get annoying to switch them around. But it's really clever to mash everything together and play songs I haven't heard in a while. Nothing better than having your own personal DJ. Clever Idea,8 months ago,0
