advertisement forcing garbage tune ear x200b thought comment ive noticed really take account listening past week specifically also maybe listen hiphop think wrapped always hiphop dominated even though thought diverse listener actually diverse dj ok job rn playing much jazz though cuz listening jazz work go nyc drill music 80’s classic music it’s weird similar problem getting old fast got trying

frame abundant grandiose jar profit aware innate straight post mass deleted anonymized redacthttpsredactdevhome make sense im going experiment maybe leave classic rock playlist week see happens next week think it’s also possible algorithm prioritizes popular artist genre degree say mostly cause someone listens lot different music majority extreme genre like metal hardcore punk algorithm still lean towards poppy genre like rap alt rock etc typically anti ai however spotify’s new ai dj amazing i’ve wanted spotify add personalized recommendation forever system learns awesome comment personally love feature well it’s pretty much area ai allowed entertainment recommendation playlist curation however seems recent change dj mesh song together like actual radio station problem cut like first 30 second song similarly cut last 30 second blend beginning next song it’s driving insane typically anti ai yet use spotify use reddit let guess use google ai decade saying youre anti ai mean dont really know much use depend opinion it’s really forgettable feature like concept can’t find really using much that’s personal preference hate ai seething passion really enjoy feature well it’s introduced couple good track actually havent tried yet ive using pretty much every day like lot way think thing say way pronounces certain thing funny change vibe angry make chuckle pull old song

ai model can’t ask ai draw cheeseburger without cheese get cheeseburger every time ask hamburger wrote “don’t repeat artists” ai isn’t comprehending “dont” read “repeat artists” instead telling ai don’t want work seamlessly tell want “i want playlist song different artist” “i want playlist song 80 later time” likely net better result “i want rock playlist unfamiliar” version includes sharp dressed man zz top 🤷\\u200d♂️ haven’t luck ai playlist try make playlist older metallica song work gave song black album tried said ok add spanish track completely redid whole thing find ability prompt dj dude it’s bad i’m problem understand could prompting problem need better i’ll even say “add songs” it’ll remove 3 can’t expect customer promoting expert feel completely underbaked seems like

spotify ever generated ai dont like always skip im paying attention yet february 25 usa spotify app ai playlist option dj x lowkey better picking music nan comment skill issue pick 5 song start every time mix song liked playlist pretty terrible ask glad work well cuz ai love dj wouldnt worry much everyone suck something use cross fade recently using ai dj faded song cutting final line song personally don’t like cross fade song like feeling song fully self contained cross fading feel disorienting understand live setting wanting dead air wondering choose use personal listening comment use 5 second crossfade make music non stop think sound great especially previous song fade end really wish spotify didnt forced fade outin song though wish smart cross fade like plexamp hate crossfade fiery passion artist wanted hear something want hear exception course they’re common turned entirely dj ignores setting crossfaded thirty second obviously bug there’s way anybody would ever want still able control crossfade make dj unusable less second cross play that’s accurate say second enough cut pause hardly noticeable unless song abruptly startstop queue yes 12 second usually listen music via playlist working working stuff around house like using crossfade give nice smooth transition time song turn listening album though plenty song outro fantastic don’t wanna miss cross fade never really transition clean enough enjoy anyway 45 second crossfade escape awkward silence betweeen song sometimes use shuffle enabled incase two song transition perfectly epic bcuz completely unexpected usually cross fade song dont work together ruin endingsbeginnings song arent meant cross faded reason dont really use anymore yeah think sound neat don’t like cross fade content song use 1 second cross fade eliminate silence song got tired dead space song can’t even imagine listening music way casually take n amount time end song default could cutting thrilling orchestral crescendo virtuoso drum solo soprano holding long note one minor key ending leave verge tears… sometimes go way end track skip winddown silence end song i’m saying i’m pure default listening cross fade incongruous maybe playlist made sense somehow overall nah gapless playback used use 6 second cross fade got sick start listening dsotm playlist didnt realise shuffle blended speak wanna dog stooge prepared epic would sound tbh don’t know i’m always switching song restarting \\U0001fae0 think using crossfade really depends genre listening lemme get example im listening something like rap kind metalcore id never use crossfade since till last second something relevant hear eg barsbreakdownswhatever im listening housetechnolofi dont despise bit crossfade 3 5 second endbeginning track i’m shuffling listening song car i’ll keep around 3 help everything blend together nicely i’m sitting listen album properly i’ll turn together get experience artist intended use 23 second give song enough time hear every second make smoother transition im listening playlist shuffle song skip back beginning hear first second though like mixed nut higedan break song amazing it’s really good lofi playlist anything else seems work well ruined hard transition song cut quick ending land certain way want hear song artist intended hate don´t like feeling song incomplete perhaps specific situation like party could work agree 5 mostly playing music background party dinner hate second silence track however music shouldn’t cross fade think classical album trad pop would nice make distinction isnt setting change length 12 second thats true thats put 1 second can’t even imagine listening music way casually take n amount time end song default could cutting effect thrilling orchestral crescendo virtuoso drum solo soprano holding long note one minor key ending leave verge tears… sometimes go way end track skip winddown silence end song i’m saying i’m pure default listening cross fade incongruous maybe playlist made sense somehow overall real i’m gonna real made comment nearly year ago forgot feature spotify even exists aa lol well returned spotify making whole new account noticed fade bit ‚funky’ sense sound weird point dont know truly song dependent keep mind listen rock heavy rock metal grunge heavy metal symphonic occasionally classic fit sometimes sometimes jumbled mess 🤷🏻🤷🏻 id imagine band using different guitar bass amp setting etc break harmony sound especially there lot going issue metal track crossfade set 3 second rarely occurs found looking issue lol side note like heavy metal give

playlist song playlist contained context blah maybe ability use ai language model search natural conversation curate playlist based feelingscontext note added note could also used custom tagging

jarring plus wanted listen someone taking nonsense id listen commercial radio use spotify avoid dj experience complete opposite past 8 month ive listening heavy metal decided try dj see would give new band related listen give conpletely different genre 50 skip gave went back playlist like 3rd time tried probably never try also fact cut first last second stupid ai talked every 5 song find really nice im usually one going comfort zone finding new music dj recommends stuff actually enjoy expanding music horizon somewhat really enjoy genre switch every easily skip different type music generally thing mood voice also really nice detail feel like personal little radio host use quite frequently great dj favorite tune even say name bit lacking personality imo dont interact like chat bot talk music doesnt make joke talk current event like human dj pretty much listen music 902010 selection limited dont like genre besides rock metal tried hip hop song actually like love love everything suggests something don’t like one button skip like play song particular time period like here october 2019 keep telling dont want listen system keep putting queue bit hit miss time tho love give

always skip new music narrow taste going work though voice mediocre best sound overdone natural dont think ai apparently voice project lead dj xavier x jernigan talk obnoxiously interview spotify management would allow make voice product idea clear voice synth product using already multiple voice option active choice one voice like nepotism instead immortalizing ai voice synthesizer company money weird like don’t make decision listen right bat click want listen music idea i’m mood lol iv using last 2 day seems playing play list shuffle haha maybe every 8 10 sound new song essentially

find “ai dj” like find way way better auto curated list play one genre vibe way basically shuffling auto curated play list ive heard lot music ive never heard today didnt hate also playing sean paul temperate dirty little secret aar like variety idk guy like working good sleep music listen excluded profile doesnt show wrap seems work keeping ai dj honestly love take request even cooler removed repetitive despite saying mix new song sometimes cut song end could manipulated spotify promote certain song like idea need work dont like cant ask play one playlist id love tend jump one playlist

boomed hello steve im ai dj immediately turned never find skipping lot think may added song huge thing given mr little jean dj voice unlistenable obnoxious american accent want dj sound like ken bruce thanks tip listening isn’t new isn’t good liked first started get stale think daylist way better kinda thing varied switch often wish could set genre parameter bc listen almost exclusive edm 15 min listening it’ll play notorious big song saved listen much old school rap stopped using bc clearly understand music taste crazy bc curated content spotify spot like theory think idea playing short block various style mixing familiar unfamiliar great potential said id love without dj voice id really appreciate stopped playing block seems like skip ten block play anything remotely unexpected here stuff havent listened since 2017 yes there reason here typical sunday vibe proceeds play genre never listen here music thats rotation lot lately play music rotation dj keep putting there definitely potential execution leaf much desired finally roll rest u usuk thing forever able specifically select ai dj one preferred genre would appealing without ability sloppy smorgasbord eg don’t want go straight nicki minaj bartok thank much excited try underwhelmed want able customize it… change voice change info dj say artist name track name year random tidbit artist adjust percentage familiar unfamiliar etc i’ve asking sort thing many year access cant find pc app may also available switzerland feature available desktop version cant find mobile spotify even use dutch never seen app tried hate don’t want fake guy interrupting music half time doesn’t even play good music that’s radio gave new obsession similar evanescence suggestion spot i’m fun voice bug little wish could pick choice voice accent i’d rather mine sound like classic mtv veejay maybe talk bit less idc never forgive new release page feature can’t find like occasionally part make playlist true complaint lack legitimate shuffle “oh chose use service bc you’re bored choice well here’s last 5 song listened morning” 🤡 think ai dj suck ball annoying it’s absolute dog shit lmao end skipping whole block time terrible garbage put fuck listening history say give shit hottest new indie available region… something fool vpn it’s talking algorithm ai could talk get meaningful selection based bit chat i’d impressed it’s repetitive thing predictable others eg acdc track lay jailbreak play talking head lifetime psycho killer road nowhere boring pretty much play stuff would listened anyway ive never found thing new interesting idea effectively useless wan hear something new want hear stuff already know ill put playlist ive made dont even it… really like coming like radio guy announcing what’s going theory fine guess dont want talk wanted listen radio dj id listen radio want music daylists still managed play obvious track whatever genre switched like great good enough know im sayin wouldnt call new music taste way picky skip 80 give decided look sure enough right thereso clicked way pronounced rudimentary peni made cackle mine always play whatever main playlist terrible neat honestly never use don’t like ai voice one time gave pop never listen pop music use spotify radio essentially except doesnt get stuck genre ai voice doesnt unnecessarily interrupt music every 4 song ive got niche taste music borderline unlistenable play fairly onpoint stuff song switch random shit spotify want promote doesnt even remotely align listening history ive spotify since beginning like theyre lacking data like i’m driving indecisive i’m around people get annoyed music theme would use 1000 toxic af like gta radio dj complete array voice personality genre radio station absolutely hilarious shocking anecdotal uncensored commentary global current affair concept completely fucking stupid play song playlist nothing anything new also worst voice world way fucking agressive sounding put kind ai dj online streaming music sure hell would deep voiced sounding dude dick mouth get annoying fast spotify smart change woman voice learn set song new something heard 100 fucking time dj voice clash music could worse like california valley girl dj different name mine xavier it’s marked beta anyone know give beta testing feedback like it’s missing mark key reason want feature lack imagination lacking cause play genre ai noticed genre play history keep giving wanted play history would play use ai dj i’m bored listening routine current dj reinforces routine anyone know give feedback spotify came post wondering ai dj exists love put lot album phone play random bluetooth would cool virtual voice saying name song artist release year album maybe little trivia song presenting next one seems something like still exist song stored phone anyone used pandora always feel spotifys music recs ai otherwise hot garbage literally worst fucking thing jeep coming back stupid reason everytime shoot foot ever made ky got boring real quick there’s joy discovery amenand sleep music day music let opt list play recommendation maybe exists already setup found poor rollout i’ve using recently it’s like year it’s actually pretty fucking banger go back artist played day none song i’ve noticed past two day time click switch thing skip song much better first came think happens use dj mode time pick song previously listened dj mode end repeating self referencing system therefore good idea go search new song expand selection also sometimes add new pop music boot stop working truck break honest break flavour fatigue lot trance acid hardstyle hardcore symphonic metal also like dub though relaxing compared blasting alignment track time youve never ever listened genre im gonna play every hit shittest music ive ever heard say whats popular right here whats popular right even doesnt share single note rest liked song say “let’s switch up” know it’s going dogshit used time listen 8 9 different genre

everyone fucking nauseating use fade option realized available u yet here music thats rotation lot lately play music rotation dj keep putting fucking annoying european country dont yet id really like try curiosity want south african accent would awesome it’s shown far new music i’ve listened one playlist idea one time play different genre either repeat track like add list learn keep suggesting genre similar one noted liked right it’s ar ai artificial repetition try setting playlist exclude taste profile idk work thanks ill give another look noticed first bad playing song playing song language lately steady stream banger end discovering song didnt know missing wouldn’t honestly love entire experiance first song point listen daily give non stop new pop never listen never dj horrible click dj thing change back usual type listen biggest complaint cutting end beginning song made post ago removed less complained sometimes give recs dead discovered favorite skramz artist like blind girl lord snow play rap caviar folk neither taste play metal handpicked slayer led zeppelin whereas metal actually like like blackgaze also understand ai dj play streamed song time spotify considering people like pop music song ever listened skip past every time keep playing play music listening lot maybe six month ago say kind music wrong like song obviously little date consistently listen genre really frustrated suggested something completely different since havent used play slvtcrusher ai dj please play old school obscure rare banger ok here yellow coldplay wish could choose parameter song 5000 play rising genre cumbia electroswing vocal men age 45 65 annoying seems whats globally popular instead whats popular within type music like series song yesterday like taylor swift u country music like whyyyy literally none music pop country despise genre actually one natural sounding ai read acquired company also voice modeling top gun val kilmer dj voicing ai spotify train software ai sound like wouldincluding cadence pause natural flow speech honestly perspective quite achievement end shuffled list music random genre 600 song liked far pretty sure shuffle play maybe 50 🙄 id take elimination shuffle every new feature spotify try dude feature literally came 6 month ago appreciate posting first ive heard feature im really liking far enough know posted almost daily go advertising digress could explain find feature cant find section disagree constantly give music artist actively avoid genre dont listen end play band like play shit like taylor swift reason fan huh 10 year using spotify never knew thanks god can’t even lie well thats even worse posted shit free mine sound like new york pedestrian half expect say heyy im walkin mean enjoy depeche mode much next guy never listened new single dj keep insisting favorite lol recommendation point sound good hopefully you’ll like i’m hoping it’ll better end seeing still ai know sometimes found feature today wtf lol start next song almost 1min 30 sec need change along cutting song point 💯 valid exact word raved “dj” husband it’s great cut favourite part yaaaas hate shit otherwise ai anything like im hoping remembering thing skip like doesnt play learns im guessing info captured want personal dj unfortunately one consequence wrong many time first start using hopwfully learns playlist direct feedback try find suggest good new music im picking post heap others complaint im wondering 90 song dj play already library artist already song liked similar 80 90 rock genre library made im starting wonder design beta maybe several version spotify threw waiting see one hate becomes standard thatd point dj region based beta theyr probably trying new country batch isn’t weird people finding lol also got last year existed month it’s search function iirc exclude stuff music taste never though tbf believe fairly new feature open playlist 3 dot scroll till see ⓧ exclude taste profile click presto undo process ⊕ include taste profile i’m guessing might work great genre music house specifically often slow start end cutting really good go spotify setting turn automix fix yeah time song least related genre artist sometimes switch whats popular obviously u crap like country music isnt popular australia jarring suddenly hear mumble rap country taylor swift literally none library like would like option opt popular list especially different country sometimes switch popular edm 80 90 kinda okay mood nostalgia instead skipping hit dj button go back stuff want overall pretty good though could change voice dj guy im fully aware use feature reguarly yet dj think want listen taylor swift told spotify play one example thanks info kinda late reply tho legend thats went saw sorry besides 7 month later reply cant flame lol nah cool spotify ai crimminal httpspreviewreddityu6uqqdf0fwb1pngwidth975formatpngautowebps08d94f032d4624ff443aa685f0760aaf5d64f463 comment tried first time gave two good suggestion like

lol guess i’ll enjoy last spotify’s ai dj x actually good i’ve noticed bunch friend listening dj x queue extended period lately first came reaction pretty mixed people thought kinda underwhelming repetitive i’ve seen either give playlist song i’ve never heard kinda different usual style end liking play top track i’ve playing last month algorithm improved time better curating personalized selection one thing grows use curious hear think comment didnt like first definitely find using lately think better job playing like think ill like latter wasnt well liked song playlist get bigger diverse dj make sense itll play stuff list anyway maybe take grain salt seems unpopular opinion kind like least sometimes ill use maybe twice week agree criticism mostly playing song ive played since

prompt instruction made cool band discovery day played cool band never knew called molotov dunno co cleared cache earlier day used couple day ago pretty much pulling recent playlist wanted 40 song would great going gym everyday overthinking playlist repetitive samey like simply wont stop trying sneak kendrick lamar sabrina carpenter otherwise classic rockmetal playlist must paying exposure something nothing listen history indicate would remotely interested artist mostly play spotify gaming working reading voice talking feel intrusive could disable talking might try currently dont use

radio station it’s pretty cool garbage feature one asked damn fresh voice good first song picked land snake 🔥 every time click ai button bottom right change station type name feel like there nothing intelligent play random autogenerated playlist get anyway got button choose another random playlist cancelled spotify clicked ai dj mistake say compulsory premium able choose feature want dashboard deep focus coding getting somewhere im interrupted tacky patter think pretty lowend realized cant remove enabled cancelled immediately i’m late thread literally purely advertisement play song haven’t

accurate im fine suggesting new music artist ive never heard ffs least semirelated musical taste got finally bro lowkey sound like donald trump sometime tho tell i’m wrong 😂 got access yesterday im loving ive never liked shuffle algo always seems play song listen playlist much get boring ai taste nailed like play chunk like hip hop group metal rather blend like shuffle we’re first name basis starting band doesnt seem anything new sound like algorithm us choosing music exact one used playing music queue run time spotify suggesting music following trend needlessly personifying existing feature presenting new absolutely love fact help revisit old favorite past im talking 56 year back song listened loop hate passion tried went bachata 80 rock modern solid mix wow there’s ai engine behind surely it’s rubbish initially super impressed playing various current favourite old favourite new discovery … … start playing absolute random highly popular stuff like queen celine dione meat loaf eagle pub classic absolute million mile away kind music listen far away it’s laughable hit skip button quick possibly could try play following day it’s ai it’s random engine try anything see stick rubbish back daily mix far intelligent would nice throw old favourite though cant fucking delete urhjhnfghk dont skip every song next click dj button bottom right playing pulled work great yes

wanting switch music genre playlist become predictable that’s right gotta listen dude talking sexual act oooh look userfriendly tidy radio garden app free show globe access radio it’s spotify want kind thing would make sense real radio integration would improve recommendation huh that’s strange mine legit play section like song even “discover” part always song already liked maybe mine janky

recently came across playlist called “power gaming” spotify noticed ai enabled mixing make song seem “gapless” seem blend song really well together isn’t crossfade feature i’m talking apparently spotify feature playlist hoping community could list playlist created spotify ai dj feature included thanks comment • hardstyle banger beast mode thought ai dj new nan comment rolling last month think pretty decent better spotify radio whatever called sad attempt pandora like taste matching think interesting people complain anything work fine really like pick good old blue tune havent listen year discovered many blue artist didnt know better discovery weekly cool hated repeated tid bit inbetween song multiple occasion listening shite thats clever interesting like personal radio host dj play song talk itd actual dj remixed song hey thats preference dj really ai honestly feel like extracting song playlist could listen playlist get result though spotify bringing ai app thought would able prompt specific request idk im missing something feel like could get shuffle button 🤷\\u200d♂️ comment doesnt seem like kind imagined would interaction ai make selection played song could listen playlist get result seems way way overblown feature imho there’s ai power playlist generationchanges dj voice voice created using sonatic synthetic voice creation technology us ai process hour worth sample someone’s voice applies algorithm add intonation inflection projection create voice model sound like real person gpt ai power chatgpt used generate descriptionsintros based scan taste profile characteristic music played feed detail voice model readprocess otherwise spotify us machine learning ml recommendation algorithm likely use combo ai ml automate creation different vibessets dj play idk seemed cool first seems sane song consist obtainable sleep bike direful bird frightening cause aback money post mass deleted anonymized redacthttpsredactdev disappointed dj play stuff stealing playlist already play stuff completely uninterested country i’m metal rock fan hate country doesn’t seem learn passing country 100 time say “ see like rock let go bit boundary…” play shite best way randomize playlist shuffle always broken im loving new dj function problem im documentation say dj give commentary song want seems give inputspeaking info press dj button switch another song anybody else experiencing dont know much ai technology guy definitely dont ofcourse dj song going based playlist looking type music listen much deviate youre listening playlist every time ofcourse going play garbage garbage want explore music actually put work get ai recognize expectation ofcourse would better able directly give prompt dj user friendly implementation ai think ai related part come naturalsounding script generates cited using openai tech gpt language model nothing reccomendation algorithm sort unrelated ive listening lot music particularly heavily instrumental based sound like ai music like last time listening orchestra cover song lot music didnt sound pleasing ear today searched saxophone found cover band album dating back 2009 top mix narrator really dumb idc y’all say hearing dude voice set nice really reason you’d want use feature im still scratching head played locomotion kylie minogue literally would’ve taken 2 second make take sort inputprompt music want listen play huge failure imo call dramatic literally serf nothing dont know real ai fake know useless feature ever 🤣 yeah wish played song ive listened might like basically repeat little playlist ive made game changer love bringing tune forgot 2017 deleted anything really ai stage theyre basically prediction engine spit calculated likely result algorithm think want certainly isnt music assistant end goal encourage listen thing spotify want listen interjecting suggestion havent used spotify month got back saw ai thought definitely way talk ai get request specific type songa particular vibe music selection algorithm always machine learning model thing different dj also us speech synthesis program talk song selected existing algorithm also ai broad enough term apply pretty much program company slap term onto anything without technically lying bc everyone assumes mean neural net feel like could get shuffle button true least shuffle song similar song played together throw extra every played quite song ive never heard pretty good similar stuff like also got sick burn saying “lemmy play big song younger” play hank williams dont listen country lol like voice it’s soothing sound like cool black guy there button give different pick want take different tangent seems give different result youre change indepth commentary seems rare ive heard mention band tour common songwriter set album detail ect edit gave detailed intro arlo park including mention mercury prize win dj talk inbetween set song little theme press dj button change set commentary isn’t anything special though like say thing lol intelligence process text format response ofcourse reasoning also able adjust response based past input even know ai tbh long drive today seemed get better time think great potential ai dj interact verbally think got hope soon current one hate voice vocab vibe kind reminds ice im fine see there… new ai dj think neat feature save looking daily mix wish custom option like different ai voice telling mood youre started cant expect much think comment voice song amazing fuck ai downfall humanity like playlist spotify creates wish dj voice available desktop anyone know date expected happen wish thing dj said didnt feel scripted always feel like thing say thing he recorded studio said everyone i’ve enjoying love haven’t repeat song yet would say greed corruption general lack morality closer downfall humanity ai know search dj come option amazing since case audio generated phone part skeptical gottttaa somr set prompt ive seen people get exact sentence except genre swapped today vibe vibe x here x like dont know wish variety word spotify ai dj radio dj nan comment im pretty happy music chooses dont like cant remember left leave dj playlist listen something else chase rabbit hole led also seems pretty simplistic using phrase background hum era etc pretty scared first 12 song picked half unliked gave like god damn pretty good don’t think feature rolled yet it’s ok i’ve account feel like long time hoping history would used keep playing newer stuff also mine doesn’t really talk much say here’s blah blah thought might say random fact nonsense like real dj mine anticipating would revolutionize way listen music got week tried time frankly im underwhelmed could achieve result playing song liked song playlist listen x breaking every 23 song tell whats going play next wanted id listen radio im certain x behind x think name xavier nice person found voice annoying ai stay id want least choice voice like siri cortana offer preference artist style fit family plan obnoxious im played song would hear target im impressed seems flat refusing play rush he’s different radio dj imo surprised hear people like tried first day came thought horrible ai dj repeat phrase voice fingerprinted black man give urbandj vibe without depth category never adjusted according location time anything really repeated including song one lot thing put werent taste touring artist maybe got better found voice over cringe found autoplay song radio better shuffle experience new update hot air opinion may updated backend worth revisiting tried feature bit housework liked part except reason played artist never listened isnt anywhere near musical taste wonder try throw curveball time time mistake thing artist pay promoted like lmao finally got day yesterday enjoy nudge along quite often dont mind beta get better wish user control could tell many song want hear talk 5 standard bit longish id prefer every three song im gonna dj never give song title artist name hopefully change would nice user could modify feature la audio version sims guy theyve chosen doesnt sound like anyone ive ever known dont know often ill wind using first got spotify wanted choose music xm satellite radio id used year hasnt changed mine doesnt speak introduced hasnt spoken since ive ai dj going 4 hour fax wish mixed song like transition new song add new beat something im enjoying started block gene simmons song mixed one jumpin gene simmons 60 lol chuckle still like dj better i’m late search find thread dj passable best music choice are… accurate guess song “i haven’t listened while” heard day hour ago one “on repeat” one haven’t heard bit worst part it’s dj it’s literally ai playlist without playlist know got end mine 15 day started repeating without dj song exactly order interaction nothing showed solid 210 potential atm it’s worse ai playlist already make dont know help add song queue dj x play next want check song artist try adding queue theyre finished itll pick right left give time get better dj showed spotify today far kind suck really looking forward ai dj yeah there interesting chatter play miss hit deleted id love every couple song hed say song artist next ups song b artist b variation dont always access phone im listening music itd nice make mental note song andor artist look later maybe dj history tab yeah turned fade transition song setting cause blended sound niceee i’ve mostly listening new music i’ve found odd go “an artist you’ve playing lot lately” played artist doesn’t get picked go second third good idea']\n"
